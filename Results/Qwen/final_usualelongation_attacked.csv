3,"To begin I think that it is great that Becky has not continued to shoplift and is trying to get her life going in the right direction. In my life one of the quotes that I go by is ""watch the company that you keep"" I go by this because the people that you urround yourself with will be the people that you begin to look to for such things as advice and comfort. If those people are not heading in the same direction as you are with your life then it could become a burden on your life and start to hold you backfrom your goals. Becky's first problem is associating herself with someone who is continuously making the same mistake that she made by shoplifting. One solution that could work would be for Becky to sit down with Jim and rationally explain to him that wht he is doing is wrong and is not only hurting the store but in the long run could really hurt him, even if he thinks that he will never get caught. The manager of the Pizzeria has to know that Becky and Jim live together and since Becky already has a pas with shoplifting her manager will automatically connect her with the missing pizzas. If talking to Jim about it does not work then the next best thing to do in my opinion would be to either go to the manager and just let him know that you have been noticng that the stock for the pizzas has been decreasing and your not sure where the stock has been going to, so then the manager can look into it. Bringing it to his attention would clear up your name because you were honest. Or another thing you could do wold be to notify the manager that you do know for sure someone has been stealing pizzas but you do not know who it is, that way the manager can address the issue to the whole staff, leave the fact that you informed him out of it and then hopefully that woud give Jim a good enough reason to stop.

Since Becky values their friendship, she should approach her friend (wow can't believe I forgot his name already)and talk to him privately about his stealing from the pizzeria.

If he does not, than that tells Becky what kind of friend he really is, so she shouldn't feel too bad to talk to the manager.

9,"Solution- A situation like this would be very hard on any one, Becky needs to look back on her life and reflect on where she is coming from and make the right decision of informing Mark about what's going on with Jim. However Mark decides to deal with it s not her concern. If Jim is not able to pay his rent thats not her business either. As a friend, as harsh as it may seem Becky would be doing the right thing. Jim would be able to learn from his mistakes if things turn out badly, where as he lost his jobor home or even both and understand that he was wrong and move on from that aspect of his life. Time is key in this situation because only time would help Jim and Becky's friendship if it goes downhill. Time, in order for him to understand. By helping heremployer's business, if Jim cant pay his part of the rent after, maybe Mark would be more generous in helping Becky out after such an ordeal.

She needs to prove that she has changed and is a better person. Since Becky is so worried about Jeff making his rent, I think that first, Becky should tell Jeff what he's doing is wrong. She should warn him that if h does not change she will tell their boss, Mark about everything. Another option Becky should use is helping Jeff to find another job so he can still pay his rent, and persuade him that the right thing to do is to fess up to their boss. If their boss doesnot accept Jeff's honesty and apology, he may be fired, so he should have another job lined up. Becky should tell Mark she knew about Jeff's actions and is the one that persuaded him to come forward.

148,"Personally, I think that Becky should first tell Jim that whatever he is doing is wrong and just not ethically right. If Marks finds that out that Jim is stealing the food then he would ask him to leave the job or may be would file an complaint to the polce. Becky should try every possible way to prevent Jim from stealing the food without spoiling her relationship with him. She should also describe the consequences if he get caught such as: police complaint following arrest, record on SSN, no respect in te society, and above all Mark would lose his faith on Becky  being Becky is Jim's friend. That would not make good impression on the any future employer and no one would like to hire them for any position.Becky should also warn that if Jim does not listento her, the she will have to report this Mark. and she might end up losing their friendship.

If this conversation does not change Jim's behavior and he continues to steal the food then Becky should report this to Mark. That might hurt Jim but Mark willbe glad and that will increase his faith on Becky. Becky woild also save her job and might also get prize from Mark for her honesty. She will surely save her job and might receive a promotion which is much needed thing for her in order to survive.

156,"Becky I believe should confront Jim and tell him how his stealing is not just hurting the pizzaria and Jim's potential future there, but is also endangering Becky's future because of her shoplifting history.  She can be blamed for the theft, and herself b fired for actions she did not do.  Perhaps this perspective of the situation would cause a change in Jim's actions. If it does not, Becky may wish to re-evaluate her roomate situation because he does not care for her well-being.  As a last resort at workshe may approach her boss with the situation about stealing the pizzas, and since Jim has several issues at work besides the stealing, she may ask Mark to use those reasons as ones given to him for him being fired, and therefore preventing some of the awkardness that might ensue if he thought the reason he was fired was Becky ""ratting"" her out.  It would be much easier for Jim to get a new job than Becky, since Becky has a shoplifting history and to our knowledge Jim does not.

227,"First of all, Becky should have talked to Jim much earlier regarding his inappropriate behavior. However, since she allowed the situation to elaborate, she should first give Jim a brief chance to make it up by having him pay for the pizzas. If he does, i is a win-win for Becky since she gets to keep her job, her roommate = half the rent, without having to worry about hurting her relationship with Mark.

However, if Jim refuses to pay, she can either try to a) blackmail him or b) go straight to Mark. Blckmailing may put Becky at risk since she already has a record of shoplifting, especially if there is no evidence that Jim took the pizzas himself. If Becky goes and tells Mark right away, she will be able to preserve her long standing relationship with hm and prove to him that her ""criminal"" past is really behind her. However, since Jim will probably lose his job, given his problematic work behavior at the pizzeria, he will most likely be unable to pay his half of the rent or simply move out altogether.

If Becky does not find a suitable roommate quickly, she will be forced to temporary go into debt. In Becky's case this would be the lesser of two evils, since if she simply stays quite about the case she is being entirely unfair to Mark; and is also at isk of multiple negative consequences such as, her losing the job and further hurting her chances of getting a new one.

This way, Mark understands that Becky needs Jim to keep his job to be able to pay for rent, but she has also done the ""right"" thing and sh has protected herself from withholding information from her boss. Doing so could lead to Becky not being able to acquire the shift manager position (and i'm assuming the higher position would result in increased pay), or Mark could even fire her as it wold appear they were working together to steal the food(assuming Mark found out about the theft).

Because of this, I would recommend a) dropping product prices, b) increasing wages and benefits for workers, and c) raising wage increases.  This will move capital to the workers, reward them for loyalty, raise morale, and increase productivity.  This in turn will result in more product sold which will eventually offset the loss of money.  While this will most likely put the company in the red for awhile.

Incentives, such as causal day, free dinners, or vacation time. Another consideration is to ask why your employees are leaving. Usually it is a lot of little things that sum up to it.

I personally don’t find much hope in the possibility of maintaining a quality group of workers at high level of productivity. I think the idea to reduce product costs initially was a good way to try to boost sales and competition in the job market, but the wage increase would be tough to conclude. If anything, I think in order to decrease the cost of shipping materials”, Acme should receive less shipped items, b/c how much of everything they receive do they actually use all of? Maybe a conclusion that could solve the problem of also having a surplus of products could be to use everything they have now and just receive shipment when they have ran out.

So if you raised the product on the marker and you know the product is definitely quality then the buyers will prefer better quality of the product and they will pay more for the gets the job done. Once the company makes the money of their better product then they will be able to afford to give their employees a higher % wage for the job and hours they are getting.

559,"Clara is a busy student as well as a part time worker. I suggest that she works in between class breaks. In addition, best way to work around her classes is to work before her day starts with class or after school when she's finally done with classes. Therefore, when she gets home, she can use her time to work on her homework/ assignments. She must make sure her schedule doesnt conflict with her sleep, daily routine as well as family time. So she must make sure she follows a routine that's best suitable for her. For instance, Clara has class at 10 a.m, she will work the few hours from 7:30 am-9:30 am if she choose then use the 30 mins int between to get to class in time and relax for a bit. Lets say she's done for the day at 5 pm. She will work 5 p.m-8 p.m. Therefore, out of the 5 days a week of school, she is already getting approximately 25 hrs. In addition, she may also work weekends. Thus, she can rearrange the hours and adjusting the hours around to suit her best when it comes down to tough weeks such as preparations for exams etc and lastly, she will have enough time at night to finish her homework and half days of her weekends with family and friends.     Best option I would do if school offers her required classes in a two or three days a week, take that and she'll be happier than attending a 5 school days. Clara can then manage more free time and less stress on how to come up with money for GAS!

665,"Clara's current job is obviously problematic and her 15 hour credit load is only one class above the 12 credit minimum to qualify as a full-time student.  As such she could drop at most one class before she loses any financial aid that requires her to be full-time.  This brings about the only practical solution: changing her work schedule.  While Clara has openly stated she does not want to quit her job because it pays well and because she enjoys the work, her job is doing nothing to further her career and is in fact hampering it.    In many fields, a student working towards his or her degree can find paying internships at companies that employ people in the student's field of study.  Sometimes these jobs are no more glorified than Clara's current gopher job but at least a job that places her around medical professionals will give Clara a better view of what her future could look like.  Depending upon the company and job description of the internship, the hours Clara works could be very flexible meaning she could work just a few hours a week when final exams come up but a full 40 hours over Spring Break if she really wants the extra money.  Also, an internship could greatly increase Clara's chance of getting a full time job at the company after she complete school.    As for the financial aspect of this solution there is much speculation and few hard facts.  The definition of Clara's problem did not state if she was fully dependent upon her income or if she has any financial reserves to draw upon.  If she needs a job to pay her monthly bills and does not have a few months worth of expenses in savings, she obviously cannot just quit her job and hope for the best which makes transitioning between her current job and the proposed internship problematic.  A short term loan from Mom and Dad may solve this problem or she may need to apply for a loan from some form of a financial institution.  If Clara has been financially responsible she should have several months worth of rent and other expenses in her savings and she can use these funds to manage the switch between jobs.    In short, Clara needs an internship type job in a relevant industry where she can learn more about the career she is working towards.  Provided she has cash reserves and such jobs exist in the field she want to work in she should quit her job soon to increase her chances of successfully completing her classes.  Even if it takes a few months for her to secure an internship, the benefits of a educationally relevant job far outweigh the cost of the temporary depletion of her savings funds.

Also, most senior citizens who require home health care/caregiving are willing to negotiate hours that will fit with their schedules and the caregiver's schedules (which will allow for Clara to have more time to study). Clara could also apply for financial aid (grants and loans) and scholarships to help pay for school. As far as school is concerned, Clara needs to set up a schedule for when she needs to study.

She could also look for study aids (books, cds, etc.) at bookstores or online to help her with improvement on study habits and clarification of the subjects she is studying.

Because Clara is not receiving any practical experiences from her current job, I believe cutting down some of her work hours is an important sacrifice to be made for her future profession in the medical field. If the company does not allow Clara to cut her hours, she should consider looking for a more flexible job, in which she is given the option to work around her school hours and study time. She can also try to use better time management of studying more efficiently if she decides keeping her job at the designer firm is absolutely necessary to get by financially. This can be done by sacrificing other activities that Clara might enjoy engaging in, such as using the weekends to catch up on school materials. She can also collaborate with her classmates and attend some helpful tutoring sessions, which might help her better understand her difficult courses with a different perspective/ approach.

The last thing she could do would be that when she is applying to graduate school, explain to them her situation and give them valid reasons as to why so some of her grades were a bit week, explaining this and how she balanced all of her activities, this would show them that she is committed able to handle a heavy work load and school.

First of all, Clara needs to plan out how she's going to go to work and study during her weeks/weekends.  I would suggest that she work as much as possible during the weekend so that she can get some of her 25 hours/week out of the way.  Say that she works seven hours a say on Saturday and Sunday, Clara would have 14 out of her 25 hours already done.  Now all she has left to work during her week is 11 hours.  She could split those hours up so that her schedule looked like this:  Monday - school, work for 4 hours, study  Tuesday - school, no work, spend the time that you now have from not working for studying  Wednesday - school, work for 4 hours, study  Thursay - school, no work, spend the time that you now have from not working for studying  Friday - school, work for 3 hours, study (since she only has to work 3 days on Friday, Clara could have an hour of free time - YAY!)  Clara also needs to make sure that there are as little distractions as possible when she's studying so that she can make the most out of her study time.

Finding out why workers are dissatisfied with their current job and why other companies employment opportunities are better would be helpful. Acme may not be able to compete with everything their competitors are doing to satisfy their employees, but even trying to compete in a couple ways could really make a difference. Worker benefits would be another way to keep employees happy. An example would be paid time off (PTO) that they could accumulate after so many days and hours worked that they didn't call in sick or that the employees were working efficiently. PTO could be cheaper than bonuses because there would have to be a incentive to get it and not everyone will work to get it. Other little things management could do is even something as simple as a food Friday, just providing a meal for employees or having a potluck. Little things show workers that their employees care make them feel important and noticed leaving them satisfied which makes them want to perform their job better to impress their bosses. One last idea, instead of a normal Christmas bonus which could cost the company hundreds of dollars, a little gift for each employer would be much cheaper! On that note, Acme company should look outside employment problems to figure out how to make more of a profit!

One is to look at the big picture and years down the line. Is this a temporary set back? Do we have to take one step back in order to take two steps forward? We need to explain that to our engineers: this is a temporary set back (if that is indeed the truth). If we increase productivity, the wage increases will come somewhere down the line.

1139,"There are several changes that Acme could make to reduce the turnover rate of engineers at the company. Most can agree that money is frequently at the root one's dissatisfaction in their career. Although Acme is unable to provide a larger wage increase, they could try offering stock options or perhaps extra benefits (like gas benefits etc) There are also many affordable options that Acme should consider to reduce this turn over rate. It's rather simple: create a pleasant work environment. This is not in reference to everybody getting along, but appealing to the human brain's desire for an aesthetically pleasing environment. These changes can be subtle and still produce happier workers. Acme could start by changing the lighting in the working area of the engineers by removing dim lighting and avoiding fluorescent lighting. More color in the environment could improve the attitude of their engineers towards their job; paint the walls (avoid grey or cream colors), brighten up common/break rooms, get more colorful art etc. Try to open up the space of their working area; minimize cubicles. Also, plants in the work environment have been proven to increase productivity and create what is perceived to be a ""healthier"" environment. All of these aspects have been proven to create a satisfying and productive environment in the home or at work. Despite the fact that other companies can provide ""more benefits"" or a ""better job"", they will most likely fail to match our productive and pleasant work environment. The engineers spend a majority of their weekdays in their work environment, making the more likely to maintain their position with Acme. These adjustments are affordable and potentially extremely effective in reducing the turnover rate of engineers at Acme Company.

1147,"Providing yearly bonuses to employees is a good way of keeping them going. I think a good idea would be to monitor each employee. Look for things like accuracy, knowledge of job, speed, etc. This will be what you base their wage increases and yearly bonuses on. This way, if someone is not working to their potential or to the expectations of the company, they will not get the full bonus or a pay increase. The employees who deserve it because of their high work ethic (especially regarding work quality and productivity level) will get the extra bonus and the ones who don't, won't. If you have a system that measures the previously listed suggestions (accuracy, etc.) then you can base it off of number results and favoritism won't be a factor either. Plus if they are not working up to the level they should be (set a level that they should be at by a certain time) it is a reason to find new employees to put in their place. All at the same time, the company should consider having fewer employees, but employees that have a good quality work ethic, can work fast, and increase levels of productivity. This way you are paying people that deserve it, but not so many people that it is costing too much money.

They need to have management or leaders keep records of this, instead of trying to remember throughout the time span to the next evaluation.

By allowing engineers the ability to get the job done according to a schedule that best works for them, we foster a greater work life balance and therefore have happier employees. This is not about 'butt in chair time,' it is about getting the job done and getting it done well. / The corporate culture at Acme should also be reviewed. Providing an open and honest environment that allows engineers to voice concerns without fear of repercussions is highly valued amongst employees. Also, management needs to be respectful of engineers as individuals; playing to our strengths and working to deflect potential conflicts so that we may do our jobs in a timely manner without having to deal with outside concerns. / Don't over-think the wage increase. We respect that the wage increase is extremely competitive in today's recessed economy. Instead, providing job stability, first class medical coverage, 401k match, and tuition reimbursement is greatly appreciated. Once we are established in our careers here it is much easier to stay with the management and coworkers we enjoy and understand. If Acme provides a sense of continuity for the engineering staff it will be easier for us to ignore recruiters and keep our focus on our projects at Acme. / Finally, make this a job my spouse loves. Make sure my benefits, my hours, and my stress level are congruent with my pay. Make sure I get the time off to go on my family vacation or enjoy my holidays. Because if my spouse likes Acme that means I don't feel pressure to leave this job when I'm at home. If you can keep my spouse happy, you keep me happy. (Note: telling me to stop bitching about my job when I get home is not an acceptable solution, per my meeting with the VP regarding this concern last year at this time.)

1157,"It would seem that the dissatisfaction of the employees would be less pay. It would be a little difficult to offer more pay to our employees and keep the cost of the product down but it would seem that the only way to keep our labor group up is by either increasing the wage to the workers to an extent or by offering some kind of benefit to our employees which is both affordable to us and worthwhile for the workers. In my opinion, it may be a bit cheaper to offer more pay for the workers since more vacation time can cause less production and benefits such as health insurance and the like can become expensive, especially for the labor force this company manages. We may make less money doing this but in a company you have to put money in to get money out. We can't have a product without employees and without of product we cannot make any money.

If a particular employee is causing dissent and upheaval, he/she needs to be spoken with privately.  If necessary, we will terminate employees who ""grumble"" and look to cause upheaval.  Finally the management must look at the benefits that the other corporations are offering and see if there are any improvements that can be made within the budget means.

1212,"My suggestion to improve both the companies financial standing, and the wages of Acme engineers is to open up new material manufacturing and shipping locations. If financially plausible, this would provide the best return to the company over time by cutting the cost of both manufacturing and shipping product by reducing the amount of movement a product requires before it reaches the market. By reducing these shipping costs, over time the company will have a larger return and can increase the wages of Acme engineers. To combat this situation immediately, it may also be necessary to put some engineers in charge of the designing and building aspect of these manufacturing plants. This will keep engineers interested in their job by giving them some accountability for the success of the company, as well as a sense of pride for jobs because they know they are needed for such a specialized venture. While this doesn't' immediately solve the problem of reduced wage increases, being honest and straightforward with company employees about the situation will go a long way in keeping engineers content with their job. With the way the market is, people can understand that some companies need some time to turn themselves around and get back on their feet. If employees are notified of the smaller wage increases and projected future increases, they might be more willing to stick around in order to reap the rewards of an expanding, thriving company. As long as future wage projections are honest, there will be no reason for dissatisfaction or a decrease in productivity. Honesty is the key, and while some engineers may still be lost to other companies, it's very likely that many will hold their ground with a company that is very revealing and honest about its approach to business and how wages will be handled.

I also believe that you need to reward the best employees that the company has. I think low turnover rate is important to the success of a company because a good company needs a veteran work force who has the confidence of the executive vice president. With there being an abundant of jobs available then there are a little of projects to be completed and you want your most qualified employees completing the projects. I think trying to reduce product is bad because the more product that is made then the better the company will look to outsiders. They can also not fill positions after someone has left and that will help keep the costs down. Or try and hire people and lower pay and that will also help.

The recruiters can still say they have ""better"" jobs and ""better"" benefits, just the benefits wont be a raise, but instead a more enjoyable workplace. Acme could also try advertising their company and hopefully earn more business to combat the shipping costs of materials.

1228,"Acme Company cannot prevent other companies from enticing their employees away. What it CAN do is provide employees with incentive to stay in their current positions, rather than leave for another company. There are several ways in which I think that this could be improved.  /  / First, on the issue of wage increases. In an environment where there is such high demand for engineers, Acme Company cannot continue to pay their engineers less than all of their competition. Neither can it most likely afford to raise wages higher than the competition. What I would propose would be a wage increase across the board from 6 percent to 8-9 percent per year, with incentive bonuses given for individual performance and for the overall group completing certain pre-defined objectives. Because this wage increase will still probably not be comparable to what is being offered at other companies, Acme Company should review it's policies to see if there are ways in which they can make their employees feel more cared-for. Ideas in this area could include: 1) Review of current insurance coverage, and attempts to obtain better coverage for employees; 2) Providing in-house day care services for employees; 3) Sponsoring various activities, such as a (mildly) competitive bowling league, game nights or instituting an occasional company outing at a restaurant or bar; 4) Creation of an anonymous suggestion box, where employees can inform management of grievances or can provide the company with new ideas to streamline processes within the company; 5) Provide small incentives, like movie passes or gift cards for attendance and performance on a smaller scale. 6) Improve and update equipment and workspace areas where possible (better chairs is always a good place to start - businesses usually have TERRIBLE chairs for employees); 7) Look into the possibility of allowing more flexibilities in work schedules, so as to allow employees to better balance work and home commitments. One area in which this could be implemented is to allow employees who perform adequately to work from home one day per week.  /  / The bottom line is that Acme needs to provide an environment that employees WANT to be in, otherwise, they will search for greener pastures.

2734,"I believe Joan should first make a pros and cons list and see if it is even worth staying in this research program. If the cons outweigh the pros, I believe she should format a professional email to Dr. Bundt letting him know that she is not interested in the research that hes doing and while shes enjoyed her time there she believes a student who is much more interested in the research may give him more promising results. If she ends up coming up with more pros than cons, I suggest she finds a way to make the research more enticing. I would first recommend that she take time to thoroughly plan out each day of her week so that way she has more time to get everything done without being too overwhelmed. In regards to making it more enticing, I think she should first try and get more involved with the other people in her research group who seem to be enjoying their time. Maybe they are bringing something to the table she isnt and it could completely alter her thoughts on the program. In regards to Dr. Bundt being a very unfriendly and difficult to please person, I recommend she does what he says the way he says it and move on. It is clear that he has his own things going on and it is not your job to please him but instead to assist in research. Even though it may be unpleasesent, its part of life and usually taking as much distance as you can between the both of you may improve your experience.

Outside of money, a worker is also satisfied if he has an opportunity to grow and eventually create something for themselves in the future. For a worker to stay at a company that pays less money, he has to be satisfied working there. The satisfaction could come from a modern workspace with one-of-a-kind equipment, providing bonuses to people that come up with ideas to improve the product, create a weekly schedule that is based on a four-day workweek.
