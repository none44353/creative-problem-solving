"To begin I think that it is great that Becky has not continued to shoplift and is trying to get her life going in the right direction. In my life one of the quotes that I go by is ""watch the company that you keep"" I go by this because the people that you urround yourself with will be the people that you begin to look to for such things as advice and comfort. If those people are not heading in the same direction as you are with your life then it could become a burden on your life and start to hold you backfrom your goals. Becky's first problem is associating herself with someone who is continuously making the same mistake that she made by shoplifting. One solution that could work would be for Becky to sit down with Jim and rationally explain to him that wht he is doing is wrong and is not only hurting the store but in the long run could really hurt him, even if he thinks that he will never get caught. The manager of the Pizzeria has to know that Becky and Jim live together and since Becky already has a pas with shoplifting her manager will automatically connect her with the missing pizzas. If talking to Jim about it does not work then the next best thing to do in my opinion would be to either go to the manager and just let him know that you have been noticng that the stock for the pizzas has been decreasing and your not sure where the stock has been going to, so then the manager can look into it. Bringing it to his attention would clear up your name because you were honest. Or another thing you could do wold be to notify the manager that you do know for sure someone has been stealing pizzas but you do not know who it is, that way the manager can address the issue to the whole staff, leave the fact that you informed him out of it and then hopefully that woud give Jim a good enough reason to stop.

"Solution- A situation like this would be very hard on any one, Becky needs to look back on her life and reflect on where she is coming from and make the right decision of informing Mark about what's going on with Jim. However Mark decides to deal with it s not her concern. If Jim is not able to pay his rent thats not her business either. As a friend, as harsh as it may seem Becky would be doing the right thing. Jim would be able to learn from his mistakes if things turn out badly, where as he lost his jobor home or even both and understand that he was wrong and move on from that aspect of his life. Time is key in this situation because only time would help Jim and Becky's friendship if it goes downhill. Time, in order for him to understand. By helping heremployer's business, if Jim cant pay his part of the rent after, maybe Mark would be more generous in helping Becky out after such an ordeal.

"I believe that Becky needs to worry about herself first and foremost. If Becky's manager finds out that she knew all along about Jeff and did not say or do anything, she could be in trouble as well, and she already has a mark on her record, and her boss s trusting her to be more responsible. She needs to prove that she has changed and is a better person. Since Becky is so worried about Jeff making his rent, I think that first, Becky should tell Jeff what he's doing is wrong. She should warn him that if h does not change she will tell their boss, Mark about everything. Another option Becky should use is helping Jeff to find another job so he can still pay his rent, and persuade him that the right thing to do is to fess up to their boss. If their boss doesnot accept Jeff's honesty and apology, he may be fired, so he should have another job lined up. Becky should tell Mark she knew about Jeff's actions and is the one that persuaded him to come forward. If Becky does not do anything to stop this, the busines, as well as her job could be in jeopardy.

This is a tough situation. Unfortunatly becky needs to own-up and be a committed and faithful employee. If she choses to do nothing she will likely lose her job. If this is a small buiness, then the missing stock proobly has not gone unnoticed. She needs to speak to her manager directly! From what it soulnds like is the manager in uderstanding and compassionate. Together they could work out a plan to catch the theiving emplyee, Jim, red handed. This would allow Beckyto remain anonymous, and would also let the employer know what is going on. A secondary outcome that this would produce is repore with the manager. Having trust in the people that you employ would be a great feeling for the manager, and would build their elationship at thie establishment in a positive way.

"One suggestion for Becky would be confronting Jim about her problem and concern before talking to Mark.  If Jim's behavior is effecting the way she can do her job she should tell him.  Also, with him being a good friend and her roomate she may want to tel him that she does not approve of his work ethic in a concerned friend way.  Jim needs to know that him stealing pizza is making her uncomfortable.  Maybe by expressing her concern to Jim it would get him to stop.  If Jim were to have a problem with her cncern, then maybe he would need to find another job.  It may not be healthy for them to be roomates and work together.  Becky should also let Jim know that him stealing pizza could also cost her the job also.  Having one roomate out of work for a brief peiod of time would be better than both of them losing their jobs.  If Jim continues with his behavior Becky should then tell Mark.

The manager then can talk to Jim about his behavior and tell him to work harder or he will terminate hi job, or stop stealing pizzas or he will start charging him. If Jim gets fired or quits, Becky will be out of luck with finances for her housing. She can solve that by finding a new, more reliable roommate.

"A solution to this issue may be for Becky to find Jim an alternate job where she does not feel as responsible to turn him in for bad behavior. This would eliminate the problem of telling someone about his behavior or if someone found out, Jim being out ofa job. Additionally, Becky could move on from her co-habitation and either move in with someone else who is more reliable at work so she does not have worry about Jim being able to make rent with the fear of him loosing his job. Then she could also tell Mrk about some of the problem behaviors of Jim and so if he got fired or punished, it would not reflect on Becky (as it would if the pizzas were brought up) but rather on his behaviors in general.

"If I were Becky I would give Jim the opportunity to stop slacking and stealing before I went to the owner. I would tell him he needs to put forth more of an effort and the stealing needs to stop, because they both have rent to pay. By stealing from te company Jim is putting Becky in a really tight corner. If in turn he doesn't change his actions,I would give him the consequence of reporting him to the owner. Although friendships can be close, a friend wouldn't put a real friend in a situation that thy had to chose between the two.
      
     Another suggestion would be to tell the owner a camera may be a good idea to put put up for precautions.That way the owner himself could review the tapes and see for himself what was going on when he wasn't arund. In this situation nobody gets blamed and if the owner goes for the idea and the friend gets fired, it was probably going to happen anyways.

"Personally, I think that Becky should first tell Jim that whatever he is doing is wrong and just not ethically right. If Marks finds that out that Jim is stealing the food then he would ask him to leave the job or may be would file an complaint to the polce. Becky should try every possible way to prevent Jim from stealing the food without spoiling her relationship with him. She should also describe the consequences if he get caught such as: police complaint following arrest, record on SSN, no respect in te society, and above all Mark would lose his faith on Becky  being Becky is Jim's friend. That would not make good impression on the any future employer and no one would like to hire them for any position.Becky should also warn that if Jim does not listento her, the she will have to report this Mark. and she might end up losing their friendship.

If this conversation does not change Jim's behavior and he continues to steal the food then Becky should report this to Mark. That might hurt Jim but Mark willbe glad and that will increase his faith on Becky. Becky woild also save her job and might also get prize from Mark for her honesty. She will surely save her job and might receive a promotion which is much needed thing for her in order to survive.

"Becky I believe should confront Jim and tell him how his stealing is not just hurting the pizzaria and Jim's potential future there, but is also endangering Becky's future because of her shoplifting history.  She can be blamed for the theft, and herself b fired for actions she did not do.  Perhaps this perspective of the situation would cause a change in Jim's actions. If it does not, Becky may wish to re-evaluate her roomate situation because he does not care for her well-being.  As a last resort at workshe may approach her boss with the situation about stealing the pizzas, and since Jim has several issues at work besides the stealing, she may ask Mark to use those reasons as ones given to him for him being fired, and therefore preventing some of the awkardness that might ensue if he thought the reason he was fired was Becky ""ratting"" her out.  It would be much easier for Jim to get a new job than Becky, since Becky has a shoplifting history and to our knowledge Jim does not.  Becky should carefully consder that when deciding to cover for her roomate's actions.

She also needs to make Jim aware that his behavior is disturbing to her and that she won't stand by and watch his counterprductive behavior, especially if it was her recommendation that got him the job.  If Jim's behavior doesn't change, Becky needs to find a new roommate while she tells Mark about Jim's issues.

"First of all, Becky should have talked to Jim much earlier regarding his inappropriate behavior. However, since she allowed the situation to elaborate, she should first give Jim a brief chance to make it up by having him pay for the pizzas. If he does, i is a win-win for Becky since she gets to keep her job, her roommate = half the rent, without having to worry about hurting her relationship with Mark.

However, if Jim refuses to pay, she can either try to a) blackmail him or b) go straight to Mark. Blckmailing may put Becky at risk since she already has a record of shoplifting, especially if there is no evidence that Jim took the pizzas himself. If Becky goes and tells Mark right away, she will be able to preserve her long standing relationship with hm and prove to him that her ""criminal"" past is really behind her. However, since Jim will probably lose his job, given his problematic work behavior at the pizzeria, he will most likely be unable to pay his half of the rent or simply move out altogether.

If Becky does not find a suitable roommate quickly, she will be forced to temporary go into debt. In Becky's case this would be the lesser of two evils, since if she simply stays quite about the case she is being entirely unfair to Mark; and is also at isk of multiple negative consequences such as, her losing the job and further hurting her chances of getting a new one.

She could explain that the things he is doing are detrimental to his job and that she doesn't wanthim to get fired because she likes working with him and because it provides an income so that they can remain roommates. Perhaps Jim will listen and change his ways. The second solution would be for Becky to go straight to Mark and explain Jims behaviors o him. She could ask to remain anonymous and could ask Mark to first talk to Jim about his actions before ultimately firing him. This could give Jim a warning that could possibly make him change his behavior for fear of getting fired.

"1.) Becky should tell Mark of Jim's behavior, but she also needs to explain her situation at home and with her jobs. This way, Mark understands that Becky needs Jim to keep his job to be able to pay for rent, but she has also done the ""right"" thing and sh has protected herself from withholding information from her boss. Doing so could lead to Becky not being able to acquire the shift manager position (and i'm assuming the higher position would result in increased pay), or Mark could even fire her as it wold appear they were working together to steal the food(assuming Mark found out about the theft). This way it would be up to Mark to make a decision, and out of Becky's hands. 
2.) Mark could tell Jim that a customer (or even a ""secret shopper"") had repored the stealing of the pizza, saving Becky's friendship with Jim, as he may not know it was her. He could then reduce Jim's work hours, as punishment, or could put Jim on the ""3-strikes-and-you're-out"" warning system. If this is the first time Jim has bee in trouble, then he has time to mend his attitude and to think about the consequences. If Jim is on a second account of mischief, then a written warning could suffice. Lastly, if Jim is on his third strike, and there is no other option other than to fireJim, Mark could suspend Jim for a number of days or weeks as punishment also. If the last option is to fire Jim, Mark could inform Jim that he has (# of weeks) to find a different job, and he could also tell Becky that she has that much time to find a diferent roommate if that's what she wishes.

"If Acme has a high number of engineers, they can let one of them go and use that engineers pay for future pay increases.  The engineer that was let go can then get another job at the other companies.  If Acme has a lower number of engineers they can put a few on part time and allow other companies to pick up these engineers.  The saved money then can be used to increase pay.

"With such a large ratio of jobs available to engineers in the market, the only way to keep a group of workers in the group is to significantly compensate them for their work.   Because of this, I would recommend a) dropping product prices, b) increasing wages and benefits for workers, and c) raising wage increases.  This will move capital to the workers, reward them for loyalty, raise morale, and increase productivity.  This in turn will result in more product sold which will eventually offset the loss of money.  While this will most likely put the company in the red for awhile.  Amazon.com has proven a company can operate in the red and still be successful.

"Engineers are very logical people.  They are mathematically trained to figure out the best ways to build or make things.  I would ask them what they really think the company can afford to do.  Give it to them as their next assignment.  Tell them, literally, “ Your jobs depend on what you come up with.” The reason you will do this is so that the engineers will not have time to contact a headhunter because they are so concerned with making a plan that will work.  They will be more productive because you are giving them something to really care about.  If the engineers reach a solution that is feasible, (which most likely they will) give them 7% raises instead of 6% raises as a job well done & boost  their egos a bit by telling them you need them to help the company succeed.  Overall, you increase productivity & keep your quality set of engineers.

Once hooked, the long-term deal will probably even out and may be less attractive in the long haul. The key to solving the problem is increasing employee satisfaction and putting the responsibility for success upon the employee themselves.  I would suggest an incentive-based program be implemented that way, Acme’s and the engineers goal become the same.  The success and profitability of the company.  It might also instill some competition among the engineers ie. The engineer who make the most money for the company and help increase productivity would reap an incentive for their efforts.  It might instill some creative and critical thinking.

"Acme needs to maintain a consistent supply of employees to decrease turnover. Since so many leave Acme in search of better benefits, that should be the primary concern. Acme should come up with some better benefits or ways to make working at their company more enjoyable.  If financial difficulties are preventing acme from doing this, they  need to find a way to get more funding for their company. They could possibly expand to other fields besides engineering or maybe merge with a larger, more successful company. They could try to be more economical with their expenses, waste, etc. or maybe try some fundraising, an engineering, bakesale could be quite successful. Another possible solution would be to concentrate on recruiting naïve college grads to work at their company fir less money, or better yet, offer internships for students and pay them nothing.

"Acme should offer profit sharing to its engineers. Even though the company (CEO/Management) would have to absorb the initial cost of profit sharing through year end bonuses or given during the time of salary increase, the benefits would include higher productivity/moral for the employees because if the company does well, they fair well. Once productivity is increased, more product is produced. The more product that is produced, the more materials that will be needed, increasing shipping will make it more likely that Acme can strike a deal with the shippers for a lower cost in exchange for more business for the shippers. Management needs to understand that keeping qualified, experienced employees is always a benefit to the company, because of the cost of training others and the loss of loyalty to a company.

If the above research shows that the price can not be increased, and the true cause f turnover and decreased productivity is an employee perception that there are better opportunities else where, upper management is either going to have to increase engineerings perception of there jobs in a way that doesn’t cost anything (Friday afternoons off, or casual dress code) or increase salaries and sell product as a loss until something else changes.

"Turnovers are very bad for companies, especially if you spend time and money to train them.  There could be multiple reasons for their engineers leaving them besides wage. Environment could be one, if you don’t like where they work, first chance out and they leave.  Benefits and incentives could help out the situation. Like 401K, health plan, dental plan. Incentives, such as causal day, free dinners, or vacation time. Another consideration is to ask why your employees are leaving. Usually it is a lot of little things that sum up to it. If a person want to take another job, you already lost them. Another issue is the increase in expenses. Maybe a more realistic approach is to increase the price of their product.  Then they could keep the wage increase incentive. There is so many open choices and hard to cut the source of the problem.  Being in a real situation would help a lot more.

"I agree with the thought that “much of the dissatisfaction is based upon the headhunter’s enticement of better opportunities in other places”.  I personally don’t find much hope in the possibility of maintaining a quality group of workers at high level of productivity. I think the idea to reduce product costs initially was a good way to try to boost sales and competition in the job market, but the wage increase would be tough to conclude. If anything, I think in order to decrease the cost of shipping materials”, Acme should receive less shipped items, b/c how much of everything they receive do they actually use all of? Maybe a conclusion that could solve the problem of also having a surplus of products could be to use everything they have now and just receive shipment when they have ran out.

"One of the first things the company needs to do is pay their employees because they have worked for the money and they should not have their wages on hold because the company is going down the drain. The employees deserve to have their pay checks before they start hiring other for the job.  For the product they had to raise it twice to cover the shipping process so yes they probably has lost some competition to the buyers who go for the cheapest product but the product might not be very good for quality. So if you raised the product on the marker and you know the product is definitely quality then the buyers will prefer better quality of the product and they will pay more for the gets the job done. Once the company makes the money of their better product then they will be able to afford to give their employees a higher % wage for the job and hours they are getting.

"There’s pretty much always a way to keep shipping from going too high.  Explore alternative methods and sources. The only solution to productivity is  to get the engineers to stay longer, so Acme must not leave the increase cap in place. Also, put some business pressure on competitors and headhunters (using methods that are maybe not seen as legal, but be careful that nothing can be proven).  I’ve taken some law courses, and I know some ways that technically legal, but very underhanded. Not much info is presented, so I can’t be more specific. I think the best solution would be to hire me as a consultant, let me examine the entire situation, and then do what I say.

"Clara is a busy student as well as a part time worker. I suggest that she works in between class breaks. In addition, best way to work around her classes is to work before her day starts with class or after school when she's finally done with classes. Therefore, when she gets home, she can use her time to work on her homework/ assignments. She must make sure her schedule doesnt conflict with her sleep, daily routine as well as family time. So she must make sure she follows a routine that's best suitable for her. For instance, Clara has class at 10 a.m, she will work the few hours from 7:30 am-9:30 am if she choose then use the 30 mins int between to get to class in time and relax for a bit. Lets say she's done for the day at 5 pm. She will work 5 p.m-8 p.m. Therefore, out of the 5 days a week of school, she is already getting approximately 25 hrs. In addition, she may also work weekends. Thus, she can rearrange the hours and adjusting the hours around to suit her best when it comes down to tough weeks such as preparations for exams etc and lastly, she will have enough time at night to finish her homework and half days of her weekends with family and friends.     Best option I would do if school offers her required classes in a two or three days a week, take that and she'll be happier than attending a 5 school days. Clara can then manage more free time and less stress on how to come up with money for GAS!

"The first questions to ask is, does Clara have to work? It sounds like she works because she enjoys it and the pay is good, but is there another support system she can use? If not, then my suggestion is that she ask her boss if she can study during any ""down time"" that she may have. I used to work at a place where whenever I had the chance I was able to work on homework. Sacrificing is part of the game, her grades are very important, so if it comes between having ""extra money"" or going to med school, she needs to decide which one is more important.

"Clara should possibly look into finding another job that doesnt require her to work a min. of 25 hours.   Because clara is not getting practical experience from her current job I would recommend maybe looking for a job that pertains to medical services.  Assuming that maybe she is working to pay for school, I would suggest looking for other payment opprotunities like grants, or scholarships so that it would be possible for her to work less and not worry so much about having a job to pay for school.

It is amazing how much time we dont have, where in fact we have much more time than thought. We just usually spend it with friends, napping, watching TV, etc. Maybe talk to her friends and pick one night a week to spend with her friends and one night to spend with family. If watching TV try to do some basic homework, or get organized during this time (multitasking is a great quality). Finally, talk to those who you are close with and explain the situation to them. It is amazing how much can be done when you have support.

With the school work maybe she could use a planner to manage her time closely and see if she can join some study groups or get tutors to help her if she has many questions. The last option I would sugest for Clara would to be look for another job, such as receptionist or such, to occupy less of her time and maybe she could take some of her homework to her job if they were not as busy or her needs were not that demanding.

"Clara's current job is obviously problematic and her 15 hour credit load is only one class above the 12 credit minimum to qualify as a full-time student.  As such she could drop at most one class before she loses any financial aid that requires her to be full-time.  This brings about the only practical solution: changing her work schedule.  While Clara has openly stated she does not want to quit her job because it pays well and because she enjoys the work, her job is doing nothing to further her career and is in fact hampering it.    In many fields, a student working towards his or her degree can find paying internships at companies that employ people in the student's field of study.  Sometimes these jobs are no more glorified than Clara's current gopher job but at least a job that places her around medical professionals will give Clara a better view of what her future could look like.  Depending upon the company and job description of the internship, the hours Clara works could be very flexible meaning she could work just a few hours a week when final exams come up but a full 40 hours over Spring Break if she really wants the extra money.  Also, an internship could greatly increase Clara's chance of getting a full time job at the company after she complete school.    As for the financial aspect of this solution there is much speculation and few hard facts.  The definition of Clara's problem did not state if she was fully dependent upon her income or if she has any financial reserves to draw upon.  If she needs a job to pay her monthly bills and does not have a few months worth of expenses in savings, she obviously cannot just quit her job and hope for the best which makes transitioning between her current job and the proposed internship problematic.  A short term loan from Mom and Dad may solve this problem or she may need to apply for a loan from some form of a financial institution.  If Clara has been financially responsible she should have several months worth of rent and other expenses in her savings and she can use these funds to manage the switch between jobs.    In short, Clara needs an internship type job in a relevant industry where she can learn more about the career she is working towards.  Provided she has cash reserves and such jobs exist in the field she want to work in she should quit her job soon to increase her chances of successfully completing her classes.  Even if it takes a few months for her to secure an internship, the benefits of a educationally relevant job far outweigh the cost of the temporary depletion of her savings funds.

"Jobs as a gopher often have some down time, taking some study materials into work could be beneficial. If this is not possible, she should study for short periods of time (15 minutes) and take 5 minute breaks, rather than studying all night long. When coming back to the material after the break, briefly revisit the material. She could also switch subjects every 15 minutes, enabling the previous material to settle. The brain is more apt to retain information if it is revisited, even briefly, and when she gets a good night's sleep, it is more likely that she will retain the information she studied. If she were to try and cram everything in on little sleep, it is unlikely she will remember what she needs to know clearly.

In the case that she doesn't need the job I would suggest that even though she loves it her future is more important so she should consider quitting or finding a less demanding job. If she needs the money than the job she is at is good because it pays well with less than full time hours so her current job is better for her than one that requires 40 hours to make good money.

"For the time being, it may be prudent that Clara take out some student loans to offset a reduction in hours at her job. If her employer would permit it, working 15 hours a week could allow her five hours more study time for each of the classes she is getting ""C's"" in.    This isn't so much a creative solution as a practical and realistic one. Student loans are inevitable for most people, particuarly with any thought to medical school. Any debt incurred from her undergraduate degree will be trumpted by loans for medical school.    Alternatively, I would recommend getting a different job that did provide her with practical experience which would be applicable and beneficial for her before medical school.

"There are several things that Clara could do to solve her problem.  One is simple.  Clara could keep her job, but cut back on the hours.  Instead of working 25 hours a week, she could work 15 hours a week, therefore having an equal school and class load.  Another idea is that Clara could talk to her bosses at work and ask if during down time at her job, she could work on homework.  Or, Clara could look into somehow possibly getting extra credit in her pre-med courses by doing some kind of study at work.  Maybe she, with permission of her co-workers, could do some kind of study about the amount of sleep an employee receives verses their work performace that day.  Or a study about the types of food, or nutrients the employee takes in that day verses their performance.  Clara needs to look for ways such as these to not only balance work and school, but to also help the two to help each other. She needs to work hard, but also work smart.

"Clara should ask her employer if it is possible to cut down on the hours at work. If that is not possible, then she could look for a job as a caregiver to an elderly adult (at the elderly adult's house). Most elderly adults need help with activities of daily living (cooking, cleaning, personal hygiene, etc.) and may need assistance with medical care (such as administering shots, keeping track of medicines taken, etc.). This could provide Clara with practical experience because she will be learning about the special needs and medical care of older adults (in addition to developing and improving on interpersonal skills and ""bedside"" manner). Also, most senior citizens who require home health care/caregiving are willing to negotiate hours that will fit with their schedules and the caregiver's schedules (which will allow for Clara to have more time to study). Clara could also apply for financial aid (grants and loans) and scholarships to help pay for school. As far as school is concerned, Clara needs to set up a schedule for when she needs to study. If she is having trouble with her classes, she could arrange for help from her teachers or tutoring from other students. She could also look for study aids (books, cds, etc.) at bookstores or online to help her with improvement on study habits and clarification of the subjects she is studying. If she fails the classes, she could retake them to get better grades.

"Clara, being the radiant and gorgeous red head she is, should quit her job as a ""gopher"" and pick up stripping at a not so local strip club, as she doesn't want classmates/cowrkers/professors to see her.  Since she will not need to work as many hours as a stripper as she did a ""gopher"" to make the same or better pay she can have more time available for studying.  While working as dancer of pleasure she can begin to look for other jobs or internships in the medical field.  The experience of being an exotic dancer will add spice and adventure in her life that will get her out of the mental rut she is in and give her the boost she needs to excel in all aspects of her life.

"Prioritizing and time management needs to be more effectively addressed. Her current job as a ""gopher"" at an architectural design firm may seem to be of high importance at the moment, given that she needs money to pay for school, gas, food, and bills; but looking at her goals from a longterm perspective is a better way to help reprioritize her schedule. Because Clara is not receiving any practical experiences from her current job, I believe cutting down some of her work hours is an important sacrifice to be made for her future profession in the medical field. If the company does not allow Clara to cut her hours, she should consider looking for a more flexible job, in which she is given the option to work around her school hours and study time. She can also try to use better time management of studying more efficiently if she decides keeping her job at the designer firm is absolutely necessary to get by financially. This can be done by sacrificing other activities that Clara might enjoy engaging in, such as using the weekends to catch up on school materials. She can also collaborate with her classmates and attend some helpful tutoring sessions, which might help her better understand her difficult courses with a different perspective/ approach.

"Get a job in a hospital or nursing home environment, like a CNA or Medication aide, where you can make anywhere from 10-13 dollars an hour and each environment is very flexible with scheduling and students workload.  A hospital requires 12 hour shifts so you could schedule 2 12 hour shifts to get good pay and still have the rest of the week's free hours for study and relaxation.  Nursing homes usually require 8 hour shifts but are also very flexible with schedules.  They work around students' schedules allowing, with due notice, special days off for study and allow you to trade schedules with other workers.  You could work every other day 3 times a week or less for good pay and still have plenty of time to study.

"It sounds like Clara's present job is the lesser of two evils at the moment. Since she enjoys it, and she most likely needs the money for school fees, she can't drop the job completely. However, she should first talk with her employers to make her work schedule fit efficiently around her other activities. Whether that pans out or not, at the very least, Clara will feel like she's taken a step in the right direction. Being a ""gopher"" does not sound mentally-taxing. If Clara can cover new material in what little study time she has, she can confirm the knowledge through maintenance rehearsal on the job. Mental reviewing and repeating what she knows and remembers will limit what she has to go over later. Finding connections between her work activities and class material will help her find ways to review it at work and have something to refer back to during exams and study sessions. Clara could also ask her coworkers to chip in, maybe asking each to memorize a single fact (not anything large or demanding) that she needs to know from the current lesson. Every time she sees him/her, Clara would have to correctly repeat back the fact. A well-maintained schedule would also be necessary, of course. Another option would be to quit the architectural design firm and find a job that is more suited to her field, limiting the different kinds of knowledge she'd be faced with every day (architecture and pre-med aren't exactly identical), meaning less interference. It would also give her a taste for her future.

With the work load getting harder and the need to receive good grades being a major factor she has to put the majority of energy into schooling. I would suggest she speak with the firm she is working for to see if they could cut her hours during semesters and up them in during the breaks. If they are unable to meet her needs then it is no longer a working relationship and she needs to make some changes. She would need to find employment that fits with her schedule. I good place to start would be work from home solutions such as becoming an Independent contractor where she can choose her own hours and potentially make a lot of money without putting in the long hours - and can work between school and studying. She should use her breaks between semesters to submit applications for grants and scholarships to help her financially, she could also explore loans to help with the cost of living. If her grades are not good enough to qualify for grants and/or scholarships then that she become a goal for her to raise her grades to be able to qualify in the future.

In this, Clara might be able to gain valuable experience for her future career while adding to the amount of time she has to study.

"I would say that Clara should start out by trying to find a less time consuming job, and one that involves her major.  Most medical schools have research labs that the professors are involved with.  I would say that Clara should ask her professors if they need a paid research assistant.  Therefore, Clara would get paid, and get experience with her major.  In addition, Clara would have more time to study, because of less hours and her travel time cut down, and she would get to know at least one of her professors better.

"Solution 1: Clara could choose a combination of hours that could allow her to maximize her study time at her current job.  (ex. she could work 8.5 hours on Saturday, and 3-4 hours on the other days of the week, etc).  She should meet with her manager and describe her concerns.    Solution 2: Clara could find work at a similar job at a local hospital, which would also help bulk up her resume for when she has to apply for a job in the medical field.  She may easily be able to find another part-time position that gives her more experience in her desired field.    Solution 3: Clara could see if her college has any job postings listed.  A lot of times they will have different jobs that are very flexible with the student's schedule.    -Clara shouldn't drop any of her classes, and should make school a priority.

"Personally, I think that Clara should drop the pre-med major and go for one in architectural design since she likes her job, but it doesn't appear like she wants to do that.  First of all, Clara needs to plan out how she's going to go to work and study during her weeks/weekends.  I would suggest that she work as much as possible during the weekend so that she can get some of her 25 hours/week out of the way.  Say that she works seven hours a say on Saturday and Sunday, Clara would have 14 out of her 25 hours already done.  Now all she has left to work during her week is 11 hours.  She could split those hours up so that her schedule looked like this:  Monday - school, work for 4 hours, study  Tuesday - school, no work, spend the time that you now have from not working for studying  Wednesday - school, work for 4 hours, study  Thursay - school, no work, spend the time that you now have from not working for studying  Friday - school, work for 3 hours, study (since she only has to work 3 days on Friday, Clara could have an hour of free time - YAY!)  Clara also needs to make sure that there are as little distractions as possible when she's studying so that she can make the most out of her study time.  And that's how I would solve Clara's problem!  :)

"Cannot do both at the same time either do one or the other is the first option. Second is to place her classes in the morning and work at night so she can get a break to do her homework. Then ask for her lunches to be an hour long due to all the homework. She needs to talk with her job and see if she can pull most of the hours during the weekend so she can do most of her homework during the week. Another suggesstion would be to set her classes in the afternoon and work night so she can do her homework in the morning and stay up late to do her homework in order to get enough sleep and do all the rest of her things.

"First, if I was her, I would ask her current manager or boss if there was anyway she could cut back her work hours due to her current school work load. Obviously, this semester is maybe only the slight case of more difficulty. Since she has been there for a while maybe they will understand her situation and be understanding knowing that she is a good student and plans to apply for medical school.     Secondly, if that does not work, I would ask for some time off to that she may catch up in her school work. If that is not an option either, than it would be better to consider looking for another job and possibly taking out some loans to help her in the mean time. Maybe she can take a position else where with fewer hours but similar pay. There is always the ability for her to work full time in the summer to make up for her loss in pay, or at least she can plan for that next summer to save money so that she will not have to be so dependent on her work pay currently.

"How solve this problem depends on the firm she works for. If she has proven to be a good employee and wishes to stay employed with the firm, she should ask for a leave of absence until the semester is over and then return to the job. If the company does not allow this, she should consider leaving the job and focusing solely on school. If she is positive she wants to work in the medical field some day, working for an architecture firm may not be the best option for her. She could take out more student loans if she needs the money, as most jobs in the medical field have loan repayment for their employees.

"To keep her job and maintain good grades, Clara should bribe her professors with either money or sexual services (whichever the professor would prefer). This way she wouldn't have to attend class, can increase her savings by working more (provided that the monetary bribes aren't too high), and wouldn't have to worry about actually learning the material until she takes the tests to get into medical school.

If shipping costs have become an issue, perhaps the first thing to do would be to explore other shipping options. See if anything is cheaper on the market.

"Provide employees with incentive to keep working for the Acme Company by either increasing wage percentages or by offering other benefits such as bonuses for higher standards of work/effort. Keeping the wage increases down to keep product price down is a good idea, but in practice, if you lose your best engineers to other companies then the company cannot remain competitive anyway. There are other ways to cut costs, either by having less engineers working for the company or by providing those that do the best work with the higher wage increases.

"Acme Corporation needs to start with employee surveys. Finding out why workers are dissatisfied with their current job and why other companies employment opportunities are better would be helpful. Acme may not be able to compete with everything their competitors are doing to satisfy their employees, but even trying to compete in a couple ways could really make a difference. Worker benefits would be another way to keep employees happy. An example would be paid time off (PTO) that they could accumulate after so many days and hours worked that they didn't call in sick or that the employees were working efficiently. PTO could be cheaper than bonuses because there would have to be a incentive to get it and not everyone will work to get it. Other little things management could do is even something as simple as a food Friday, just providing a meal for employees or having a potluck. Little things show workers that their employees care make them feel important and noticed leaving them satisfied which makes them want to perform their job better to impress their bosses. One last idea, instead of a normal Christmas bonus which could cost the company hundreds of dollars, a little gift for each employer would be much cheaper! On that note, Acme company should look outside employment problems to figure out how to make more of a profit! Acme company might need to find a different shipping method or ship smarter to reduce that cost. Reduced shipping cost would equal more profit and more profit means more money for employees, happier employees equals better productivity which in turns equals better competition with competitors.

"If Acme is wanting to keep its engineers happy and remain competitive compared to other companies they should investigate what is being offered by other companies, and determine a way to emphasize the points that they are better than the other offers. Also, if they cannot increase pay of the engineers they should look in to offering other incentives periodically that would keep the engineers such as: vacations, gifts, events, benefits. If the groups of engineers is small they should also look in to personal aspects that the engineers need. Maybe some would appreciate things that the others would not and offer differences in benefits that would accommodate them the best.

Some of the job's that are created per one trained engineer could be an employee being responsible for advertising the product. Another way to increase our quality of our product and make ours stand above others is to find certain ways to overmatch our competitors by simply making our product better. For example, if it were a car being the product, make our car more fuel efficient and strong at the same time. I would talk to my engineers to devise a plan to do this, simply because I cannot do this on my own. This would ensure that those 12 jobs per one trained engineer have a job and can keep wage.

"In order to maintain a high level of productivity without increasing the turnover rate of your engineers, I would ask you to consider laying off a handful of engineers. Now, this means to place them effectively in a different position, maybe speaking with some recruiters to help them be placed in a different location. After they have been let go, you can increase the level of pay to the highest quality of engineers that you kept on payroll. This will mean a moderate increase in the amount of work they will need to perform, but they should expect that increase with the increase in pay. This will ensure that the employees will stay with Acme, and become happier with wage increases. If necessary, after a six month period, if the employees are voicing concerns over the amount of work not being worth it even with the increase in pay, I would recommend adding external benefits. This could be in the form of gym memberships or memberships to local places, i.e. the zoo. This would not be too costly and would make the employees content.

"Well, it seems impossible to keep up a high quality group of engineers without a good wage. So naturally, decreasing their wages will make them upset. To ask the engineers to keep up such a high productivity without earning the pay they deserve, it's unlikely. The only solution I can think of is to promise the engineers something worth sticking around for. For instance, when the money problems Acme is facing get taken care of, they take care of any debt, and become beyond stable,  they can begin to pay the engineers what they deserve. In addition, for agreeing to lower wages for that whole period, the engineers should get a good size bonus.

Many times people loose sight of this, a concrete reminder may be helpful.  As well, implementing a new program that increases positive energy may increase productivity as well as employee contentment.

"There just isn't one path that can be taken to eliminate/decrease engineer turnover at Acme. In today's economy, holding onto a stable job is very important especially considering that we aren't letting these engineers go. There are many ways to keep these engineers happy and productive. One is to look at the big picture and years down the line. Is this a temporary set back? Do we have to take one step back in order to take two steps forward? We need to explain that to our engineers: this is a temporary set back (if that is indeed the truth). If we increase productivity, the wage increases will come somewhere down the line. Staying with Acme for the long run is the better road to take for these engineers rather than leaving Acme for a potential ""better"" job. I will be honest with our engineers and explain the situation to them. I will hide nothing for them and explain the reason behind the lack of a wage increase this year.

"There are several changes that Acme could make to reduce the turnover rate of engineers at the company. Most can agree that money is frequently at the root one's dissatisfaction in their career. Although Acme is unable to provide a larger wage increase, they could try offering stock options or perhaps extra benefits (like gas benefits etc) There are also many affordable options that Acme should consider to reduce this turn over rate. It's rather simple: create a pleasant work environment. This is not in reference to everybody getting along, but appealing to the human brain's desire for an aesthetically pleasing environment. These changes can be subtle and still produce happier workers. Acme could start by changing the lighting in the working area of the engineers by removing dim lighting and avoiding fluorescent lighting. More color in the environment could improve the attitude of their engineers towards their job; paint the walls (avoid grey or cream colors), brighten up common/break rooms, get more colorful art etc. Try to open up the space of their working area; minimize cubicles. Also, plants in the work environment have been proven to increase productivity and create what is perceived to be a ""healthier"" environment. All of these aspects have been proven to create a satisfying and productive environment in the home or at work. Despite the fact that other companies can provide ""more benefits"" or a ""better job"", they will most likely fail to match our productive and pleasant work environment. The engineers spend a majority of their weekdays in their work environment, making the more likely to maintain their position with Acme. These adjustments are affordable and potentially extremely effective in reducing the turnover rate of engineers at Acme Company.

"The problem at hand seems to deal a lot with the issue of costs for the company. It is clear that we need to keep engineers on if we are to remain successful. I recommend a wage freeze for anyone at upper management and above so some money can be allotted to the engineers to entice them to stay. Secondly I propose a green initiative that would reduce waste and consequently costs in all factors of the company so as to free up more money to help keep a quality group of engineers and to bring in more to reduce the work load of the engineers we have.

"I feel it would be to Acme's advantage to decrease the wage percentage to about 4. The reason being, if costs of materials and shipping increases there is no worry about money management. I also feel that there should be a decrease in the amount of jobs for trained engineers. Maybe a decrease to about 8 or 9. This would allow better productivity in areas if an engineer involved with less jobs than more. Also, limiting the amount of jobs would make for a decrease in the amount of ""better opportunities"" for engineers because they are trained in less of an abroad area and more specific.

"In order to improve the quality of engineers at  a high level of productivity, I believe that it would be best for the Acme Company to increase the benefits that the engineers receive. For one, the Acme Company could give incentives to any employee that excels in his or her duties. Secondly, the Acme Company could give great health benefits, including dental and vision, to all engineers in the Acme Company. Moreover, the company could give out bonuses at the end of the year.

"Providing yearly bonuses to employees is a good way of keeping them going. I think a good idea would be to monitor each employee. Look for things like accuracy, knowledge of job, speed, etc. This will be what you base their wage increases and yearly bonuses on. This way, if someone is not working to their potential or to the expectations of the company, they will not get the full bonus or a pay increase. The employees who deserve it because of their high work ethic (especially regarding work quality and productivity level) will get the extra bonus and the ones who don't, won't. If you have a system that measures the previously listed suggestions (accuracy, etc.) then you can base it off of number results and favoritism won't be a factor either. Plus if they are not working up to the level they should be (set a level that they should be at by a certain time) it is a reason to find new employees to put in their place. All at the same time, the company should consider having fewer employees, but employees that have a good quality work ethic, can work fast, and increase levels of productivity. This way you are paying people that deserve it, but not so many people that it is costing too much money.

"The bottom line is that the engineers are not happy about their pay.  Acme needs to be honest with their staff, and tell them they are in a tight position right now, but hopefully the company will get through their tight spot when the economy starts to look up.  Acme may also want to have annual evaluation on the employee's work.  Those who are good workers, work well with others, get to work on time, etc. will have a higher pay raise than those who do not.  They need to have management or leaders keep records of this, instead of trying to remember throughout the time span to the next evaluation.  This will give the employees incentive to come and work hard at their job, which may help the increase in the product going out.

"This situation wouldn't be a problem if the engineers were happy. People are leaving for certain reasons and it is most likely attributed to the fact that they can find better pay elsewhere. Acme needs to weigh the pros and cons here. Which is more important? Sticking to a policy or having a lower turnover rate and happier engineers? A survey could be beneficial for gaining information and could be sent out among current employees and to those who have already left the company. Also, having a liaison engineer work with the other engineers to find a solution and find what they want could be positive. Then, the liaison could speak to management and see what they can figure out.

Since they want to keep the quality of the engineers and increase the level of productivity, they can do so by creating a more suitable environment for them. They can add some ""activities"" now and then to keep the interest in the group. For example to keep the attention from the workers they can have rewards such as PTO (paid time off) time after performing such tasks. Or they can have some fun activities such as bingo days. By adding these activities or ""rewards"" then they can keep the attention of the engineers. Thus even increasing their productivity.

"It's obvious to me that Acme will continue to lose quality engineers if solutions to their wage and benefits situation isn't addressed. Since their wages can't be increased, the solution needs to come in the form(s) of benefit improvements that are cost effective for Acme while genuinely improvements for the engineers. First, I would suggest getting rid of any company fees the engineers are now having to pay for: gym memberships, fuel costs for company cars, etc. Secondly, their work areas and equipment could be upgraded in areas where they feel the most need. If these upgrades and fee dismissals cost under a bottom line wage increase which could even be discussed; I would recommend implementing these measures soon. Also, more employee family fees for participation in outside activities such as the ones enjoyed by employees on premises here could be discussed with the engineers: YMCA memberships, etc. Just getting into discussions with the engineers about their situation could inspire more company loyalty from their group.

"In order to retain and attain quality engineering talent Acme needs to review and formalize the following policies: / First, engineers are highly skilled professionals who deserve dignity in what is expected of them in the workplace. In order to foster this dignified environment Acme should consider flexible hours and the potential for telecommuting. The traditional 40 hour work week is a bit passe and not appropriate in today's technological environment. By allowing engineers the ability to get the job done according to a schedule that best works for them, we foster a greater work life balance and therefore have happier employees. This is not about 'butt in chair time,' it is about getting the job done and getting it done well. / The corporate culture at Acme should also be reviewed. Providing an open and honest environment that allows engineers to voice concerns without fear of repercussions is highly valued amongst employees. Also, management needs to be respectful of engineers as individuals; playing to our strengths and working to deflect potential conflicts so that we may do our jobs in a timely manner without having to deal with outside concerns. / Don't over-think the wage increase. We respect that the wage increase is extremely competitive in today's recessed economy. Instead, providing job stability, first class medical coverage, 401k match, and tuition reimbursement is greatly appreciated. Once we are established in our careers here it is much easier to stay with the management and coworkers we enjoy and understand. If Acme provides a sense of continuity for the engineering staff it will be easier for us to ignore recruiters and keep our focus on our projects at Acme. / Finally, make this a job my spouse loves. Make sure my benefits, my hours, and my stress level are congruent with my pay. Make sure I get the time off to go on my family vacation or enjoy my holidays. Because if my spouse likes Acme that means I don't feel pressure to leave this job when I'm at home. If you can keep my spouse happy, you keep me happy. (Note: telling me to stop bitching about my job when I get home is not an acceptable solution, per my meeting with the VP regarding this concern last year at this time.)

"It would seem that the dissatisfaction of the employees would be less pay. It would be a little difficult to offer more pay to our employees and keep the cost of the product down but it would seem that the only way to keep our labor group up is by either increasing the wage to the workers to an extent or by offering some kind of benefit to our employees which is both affordable to us and worthwhile for the workers. In my opinion, it may be a bit cheaper to offer more pay for the workers since more vacation time can cause less production and benefits such as health insurance and the like can become expensive, especially for the labor force this company manages. We may make less money doing this but in a company you have to put money in to get money out. We can't have a product without employees and without of product we cannot make any money.

From this a superiority level can be established where trained engineers that have gone through the classroom and training will be responsible for training others. This will create a group of engineers that are highly trained and experienced.  Set a goal for these employees whether it be  a certain level of training or skill or a set time being employed when they can receive a wage increase.  This will increase productivity and decrease turnover as long as employees have something to work toward and see benefit out of it.  Make it a point that there isn't anything better than Acme.

"A solution to this problem could be cutting back expenses in other areas along with the money saved from reducing products. With this money they can offer their engineers things they couldn't before. The engineers would receive better benefits and increased wages. To keep productivity at a maximum you could offer some sort of bonus to getting a certain amount of things done. With increased benefits and wages the engineers would have no reason to talk to other recruiters and want to leave Acme.

Stock options are another way to get people to feel more committed and invested into the company.  Having a strong sense of pride on one's work is a powerful motivator to do better work.

With the upper management holding that wage increases should be held at 6% then I could see how the engineers would lose care and focus.

The old saying goes that if you're good at something, never do it for free. Which is what your employees are seeing. Why would they want to work here and know that they have no chance of expanding their pay grade past 6%? If another company offers a more lucrative deal to them and they are getting paid better and with more benefits than you should look at them and ask yourself ""what are they doing correctly that we aren't ?""

"If the main concern is to maintain a quality group of engineers at a high level of productivity, then I feel as though it is important to make sure that the engineers are satisfied. It seems as though when they are dissatisfied that production tends to decrease and turnover in their position seems to increase. I feel as though you need to investigate what it is that is causing the engineer group to be so dissatisfied. It has been stated that Acme's policy on wage increases has added in to these harsh feelings from the engineer group. Then I would say that you should review what Acme's policy on wage increase is and possibly make some changes to this policy. I know that money is tight and that product costs are increasing. However, it does no good to hold wage increase and continue to lose quality workers and waste money on recruiting, training, and hiring. It may be more beneficial in the long run to release the hold and allow the workers to be happy. It is hard to run a company effectively and efficiently when they aren't any workers.

"I would propose to end the wage holding, but with minimal increases. This way, the workers will not feel as though they are not being recognized, and can at the same time appreciate the company's interest in them as individuals who need their fair share of the profits of the company, not just as pawns in the company's game to make more money. In doing so, I believe productivity will increase, justifying wage increases, even if it is a little. Based upon doing subsequent research on the profit yielded from this method, the company could readjust the wage increases accordingly, even increasing them if their budget allows, rather than keeping the extra for profit. I think it would create a cycle of happier and more productive employees when they realize they are both necessary drivers of and have positive impacts on the company.

"My suggestion to improve both the companies financial standing, and the wages of Acme engineers is to open up new material manufacturing and shipping locations. If financially plausible, this would provide the best return to the company over time by cutting the cost of both manufacturing and shipping product by reducing the amount of movement a product requires before it reaches the market. By reducing these shipping costs, over time the company will have a larger return and can increase the wages of Acme engineers. To combat this situation immediately, it may also be necessary to put some engineers in charge of the designing and building aspect of these manufacturing plants. This will keep engineers interested in their job by giving them some accountability for the success of the company, as well as a sense of pride for jobs because they know they are needed for such a specialized venture. While this doesn't' immediately solve the problem of reduced wage increases, being honest and straightforward with company employees about the situation will go a long way in keeping engineers content with their job. With the way the market is, people can understand that some companies need some time to turn themselves around and get back on their feet. If employees are notified of the smaller wage increases and projected future increases, they might be more willing to stick around in order to reap the rewards of an expanding, thriving company. As long as future wage projections are honest, there will be no reason for dissatisfaction or a decrease in productivity. Honesty is the key, and while some engineers may still be lost to other companies, it's very likely that many will hold their ground with a company that is very revealing and honest about its approach to business and how wages will be handled.

"I think wage increases at a  6 percent level is fair and a little generous. Bottom achieving engineers shouldn't receive a 6 percent increase because their job performance doesn't reflect a raise. I would let them go if they found a better paying job because it's costing the company more money to keep them on  their current salary. I also believe that you need to reward the best employees that the company has. I think low turnover rate is important to the success of a company because a good company needs a veteran work force who has the confidence of the executive vice president. With there being an abundant of jobs available then there are a little of projects to be completed and you want your most qualified employees completing the projects. I think trying to reduce product is bad because the more product that is made then the better the company will look to outsiders. They can also not fill positions after someone has left and that will help keep the costs down. Or try and hire people and lower pay and that will also help.

Then I would also look to recruit a few younger engineers such as ones who recently got out of college to have the young and the knowledge of the new era of engineering and the updates that have happened in the last years so our company stays up to date and more efficient for the common day economy.

Also, ACME could pay the engineers a little more, but needs to higher more quality employees that will ensure productivity.  By paying the quality engineers more and higher less, productivity should stay the same.  Also, if ACME can save more money doing so, they can offer benefits for those employees to keep them around and work harder.

At that time their employees will be regaining all the great benefits that the company had recruited the engineers with.

So, the company needs to look ahead to the future sales and try to have some smaller benefits for the employees until the larger one's are available.  Some of the smaller one's could be a company dinner or a small added bonus to one of their checks.

"Well, from speaking from previous experiences, if you can make a work environment fun and desirable to be at it can persuade people from leaving. This can be done through certain minor changes and will hopefully boost moral and loyalty to the company. A good way to bring your employees together to be more social will allow them to make bonds with other people in which the want to keep. Like have a pizza party the last Friday of each month.  Also the supervisors must very closely watch the way in which they speak to their employees for if they feel degraded they will be apt to leave. Another fun thing to increase moral would be to have some sort of competition between the employee on productivity for the week and the winner gets an extra compensation on their checks.  /

"There obviously needs to be something done about the wages.  A vast majority of workers contribute to a job only if they feel they are getting what they deserve from the work.  The workers are feeling underappreciated and for this reason there needs to be an increase in the wage increases.  Also, benefits could be improved in order to entice workers to stay.  These benefits, however, should only be given after the employee has worked there for a good amount of time. maybe a year to two years before certain benefits apply.  To increase production, there should be an attempt to increase accountability of for the products produced.  Perhaps splitting the engineers into smaller ""teams"" and pairing them with small ""teams"" of other departments likes sales and advertising would make everyone take more pride in their work. This would be effective because then instead of trying to please management, everyone would be working to help each other out and for pride.  This would also create stronger intrapersonal relationships that would be more likely to retain employees.

"In order for Acme to maintain a quality group of engineers without giving them a raise might be hard to do. I suggest that instead of giving them a raise, make their work environment more enjoyable. You could maybe have longer lunch breaks, employee parties every so often, more paid vacation time. As long as these don't cost the company too much, if will most likely be cheaper than giving the employees raises. The recruiters can still say they have ""better"" jobs and ""better"" benefits, just the benefits wont be a raise, but instead a more enjoyable workplace. Acme could also try advertising their company and hopefully earn more business to combat the shipping costs of materials. They could also try to find the products they need locally instead of having them shipped. That could save a lot of money.

"Acme Company cannot prevent other companies from enticing their employees away. What it CAN do is provide employees with incentive to stay in their current positions, rather than leave for another company. There are several ways in which I think that this could be improved.  /  / First, on the issue of wage increases. In an environment where there is such high demand for engineers, Acme Company cannot continue to pay their engineers less than all of their competition. Neither can it most likely afford to raise wages higher than the competition. What I would propose would be a wage increase across the board from 6 percent to 8-9 percent per year, with incentive bonuses given for individual performance and for the overall group completing certain pre-defined objectives. Because this wage increase will still probably not be comparable to what is being offered at other companies, Acme Company should review it's policies to see if there are ways in which they can make their employees feel more cared-for. Ideas in this area could include: 1) Review of current insurance coverage, and attempts to obtain better coverage for employees; 2) Providing in-house day care services for employees; 3) Sponsoring various activities, such as a (mildly) competitive bowling league, game nights or instituting an occasional company outing at a restaurant or bar; 4) Creation of an anonymous suggestion box, where employees can inform management of grievances or can provide the company with new ideas to streamline processes within the company; 5) Provide small incentives, like movie passes or gift cards for attendance and performance on a smaller scale. 6) Improve and update equipment and workspace areas where possible (better chairs is always a good place to start - businesses usually have TERRIBLE chairs for employees); 7) Look into the possibility of allowing more flexibilities in work schedules, so as to allow employees to better balance work and home commitments. One area in which this could be implemented is to allow employees who perform adequately to work from home one day per week.  /  / The bottom line is that Acme needs to provide an environment that employees WANT to be in, otherwise, they will search for greener pastures.

"First of all the management needs to sit down with the engineers and explain to them how valuable and appreciated they are at Acme.  They should make sure the engineers realize that Acme is a great company and they will work with professional people there and make sure they know what they will be losing if they decide to leave. The main thing you need to focus on is finding a way to reduce shipping costs without raising the price of the product.  -- Ship out bigger loads and less at a time. Another thing to focus on is cutting costs in any other way. One thing that could be done to cut costs somewhere else is to buy less quality material, but the bad thing about that is it would not be fair to the customers, which isn't good for them or us.  When you sit down and talk with the engineers you need to explain to them that you should not have said there would be wage increases in the first place. You should explain that they will receive it in the future when things get better with the company.  Make the engineers feel like they are valued and respected at this company.  Also, explain the wage miscommunication won't happen again in the future-- if you a loyal to you employers, they are more likely to me loyal to your company.

"When initially reading this, I wondered why there was no mention of Becky confronting Jim. Deciding to have a serious discussion with him is not a bad idea and, if done without harshness (but with enough assertiveness), it can help the situation. Becky isconflicted, and her explaining that to Jim is important. Jim needs to know how much Mark has helped her out, and that Mark gave her a chance because he saw she needed one. If she explains her responsiility to Mark now because of all that he's done for herover the past three years, he may understand the extent to which the job matters. Becky must also be assertive, though, and demand that Jim do his job and improve within a short amount of time because letting Mark down is not an option. And, if he doesn'tmake the appropriate changes within the next pay period (or whatever she feels necessary), she'll be looking for a new roommate. Regardless of being friends, if he can't pay the rent, it won't matter. She won't be able to keep him as an employee if he doen't start to improve his work performance.

"Becky should accept the shift manager position for the summer because she will make more money and will earn a prominent work position that she can use for future jobs, especially considering that she has a theft record. She also should inform Mark about he issues involving her roommate, Jim. Depending on Becky's ability to emotionally manage conflict, she could either ask Mark to keep the source of information anonymous as it is a professional environment and the identity of the informant isn't as importnt as the issues. If Mark gives Jim a second chance, he can keep his job and Becky will continue to have a stable income relying on two persons. If Jim loses his job over the situation, Becky should be financially secure for the summer with her new positin, which would allow for her to find a new roommate. Of course, depending on the legal situation of the rental property (such as the lease), Becky can choose to kick out Jim if he cannot make due for rent. She may be losing a friend over the situation, bu she will also be losing someone who isn't a positively influential person to be associated with or even to be living with.

"Start looking for a job that pays well and is flexible with student hours (server, delivery driver, etc.). Schedule things around so that you can work as many hours as possible but still have ample time for studying. Setting aside specific study time is iportant. Start earning and saving money from the new job while also continuing your education. Then, sometime before winter snow hits, buy a vehicle from the uncle that will be dependable using the extra money you've saved from work. At this point, you ca cut back the hours if needed or just adjust to maintain your well-being. I think everyone wins with this plan. It requires some extra upfront work but the end result will be better than settling on something easier/simpler.

"Lisa is happy to marry Frank in order to stay with him and placate her parents. Frank is uncommitted to the relationship and wants to start a new life with his new job in a new city. Frank is settled with the idea of the new job offer and going alone. Lisa is more committed to the relationship than Frank.
Frank should move to his new job and live alone, leaving Lisa to complete her studies as he clearly does not love her enough to commit.

Of course, Becky does care a lot for Jim, but if Jim is being a criminal and he does not listen, then Becky has no choice but to tell on Jim and then having another friend, whether she finds online or not, to take Jim's place. That way, that person can pay the rent and Jim can be disciplined and learn his lesson for stealing.

Again, if this keeps happening she should tell Mark and explain that he can pay him back but he can't lose the job.

She should then ask Mark if he has noticed anything different about Jim. She should also clarify Mark's policies about employees taking home food, not being productive, etc. If Jim's behaviors continue she should tell Mark what is going on. She seems to be a very good worker who really needs the job so she shouldn't be put into a situation where she may get fired. Ask Mark that if he decides to talk to Jim keep who told him anonymous or say a customer complained.

Say ""however, I know if I speak to Mark, he will fire you, Jimbo. But we can't afford that, so I have to let this one slide. I think I will anonymously mention to Mark that we need more security cameras in the store.""
PLAN B: Becky knows that Jim took the pizzas, so that means the store is missing supplies. This means that she could easily tell Mark supplies are missing, and that someone must have stolen them during their shift BECAUSE they were understaffed and could not oversee the freezers as well. This would force Mark to either hire more employees and suspect nothing, or it would cause him to increase security precautions in the store and leave Jim unharmed. After more employees are hired (if they were hired) tell Mark the truth, and get Jim fired. Make him get a different job, but never tell Jim that Becky told Mark.

"Since Jim is a good friend and it would potentially damage their relationship if Becky told Mark, Becky has to have a conversation with Jim about what he is doing. Since Jim is stealing, Mark may notice but suspect Becky is the one stealing since she was previously a shoplifter. When Becky speaks to Jim about what he is doing, she needs to explain how this could lead Mark to believe that she is really the one stealing, not Jim. She should also mention that nowhere else will hire her if she gets fired, which means that if she loses this job, she could become unemployed and have nowhere else to work. This leads to Becky being unable to pay rent. Becky can use two things Jim cares about to convince Jim to stop what he is doing: their friendship and having rent paid.

Also explain that she does not want to get him fired because she knows he too needs it to pay for rent. Tell him that he should come clean to his boss and maybe ask if the employees could get a discount on food so in the future he could buy food for his friends without having to pay as much. If Jim still does not care then Becky needs to explain the situation to her boss and see if he would be willing to keep Jim but downgrade his pay until he becomes trustworthy again.

"Becky should talk to Mark and address the situation to him. The way that she should bring this up is by verbatim telling him the problem. Mark seems like a very understanding man and clearly is looking out for Becky and I am sure that he would help her come up with a way to address Jims behavior. Now, I would recommend Mark address Jims behavior by telling him that his actions have consequences and that hes implemented new rules to address the recent issues hes been noticing in the work place. I suggest Mark take off from Jims paycheck everytime he steals from the job (also I suggest he find out how much their rent is from Becky so that he knows how much is too much to take away so he can still make rent). I also recommend that Mark tell Jim that everytime he is rude to a customer he has to clock out and calm down (clocking out = not getting paid). This will give him incentive to be more respectful because he does not want to lose making money because hes in time out

"Joan could first try and seek assistance from some of the other students that appear to enjoy the work. If she still likes this field of work and just not this particular project, she could try and make it through by talking to and communicating with the other students. And then when she is done she would have the job experience and made connections that may be useful in her future. She would also have learned what she does not like in this field and can avoid it in the future. However, two years is a long time and if it is really bad for her I think she could talk to the head of the department and tell him that it hasn’t been working for her. Since they are friends she does not have to tell him how Dr. Bundt is difficult and unfriendly. But she could ask Dr. Johnson's advice and see if switching is possible.

"Since Joan's goal is to increase her opportunities upon graduation, it is very valuable that she makes a good impression on Dr. Bundt, and is likely a driving motivator that makes it difficult for her to quit or find a different project. However, if Joan were to take on a more organizational role in the research group, she would be able to minimize the confusion and communication aspects of the project. For example, and email exchange at the beginning of the week asking for a task list would help to clarify things significantly. It is also possible that her perspective is skewed, and other students that have worked on the project have struggled with these same issues and have found solutions, but do not show their discontent because it is not socially acceptable. If Joan were to reach out she would likely find that more people are experiencing similar issues and can collaborate with others to find viable solutions.

"If Joan feels like dropping the program entirely could be detrimental to her career opportunities in the future, she could try to turn her situation into a psychological study itself. For example, she could record every day she feels dissatisfied and why she felt dissatisfied. Then, she could begin asking her colleagues why they feel satisfied with their work and see if there are any correlations between the work and learning style, socioeconomic status, etc. She could use this data to create a psychological analysis on why some people perform better in research settings than others and use her findings as evidence for her qualifications for job applications.

"I believe Joan should first make a pros and cons list and see if it is even worth staying in this research program. If the cons outweigh the pros, I believe she should format a professional email to Dr. Bundt letting him know that she is not interested in the research that hes doing and while shes enjoyed her time there she believes a student who is much more interested in the research may give him more promising results. If she ends up coming up with more pros than cons, I suggest she finds a way to make the research more enticing. I would first recommend that she take time to thoroughly plan out each day of her week so that way she has more time to get everything done without being too overwhelmed. In regards to making it more enticing, I think she should first try and get more involved with the other people in her research group who seem to be enjoying their time. Maybe they are bringing something to the table she isnt and it could completely alter her thoughts on the program. In regards to Dr. Bundt being a very unfriendly and difficult to please person, I recommend she does what he says the way he says it and move on. It is clear that he has his own things going on and it is not your job to please him but instead to assist in research. Even though it may be unpleasesent, its part of life and usually taking as much distance as you can between the both of you may improve your experience.

"Given the high turnover rates of engineers, place a higher emphasis on benefits for older and more experienced engineers. Some of the possible benefits might include giving the employees a partial amount of stock in the company after they have worked there for multiple years. Another incentive for these engineers might be to offer them higher positions in the company and give them more chance to rise in the company's hierarchy after working there for multiple years. Other incentives to obtain engineers might include paying for their college education in exchange for a certain number of years of loyalty and service two the company.

"It seems like the problem is based on incentives. Since there is more incentive to work at other companies (mainly money), the engineer decides in his or her interest to switch jobs to a more profitable one.

Outside of money, a worker is also satisfied if he has an opportunity to grow and eventually create something for themselves in the future. For a worker to stay at a company that pays less money, he has to be satisfied working there. The satisfaction could come from a modern workspace with one-of-a-kind equipment, providing bonuses to people that come up with ideas to improve the product, create a weekly schedule that is based on a four-day workweek. (studies in Finland have shown that a four-day workweek is more productive than a five-day workweek, even though the workers spend less time on a problem.)

If a worker has a family and he gets the opportunity to only work four days instead of five for the same amount of money, he will reconsider if the extra money from the other job is worth considering.

They should have the ability to do this if they are raising prices, but only if revenue is staying the same amount. If they keep their prices below other stores they should be getting the business they need to make money and increase pay for their engineers.

"My opinion is that if Acme feels as if they cannot increase the wages for their employees they should not be in business, but I will still suggest a solution. Acme can target a certain age group for hiring practices such as teenagers. Most teenagers do not need a job to live more so just to have their own money. They must also give these teenagers flexible schedules and lots of work benefits. That doesn't mean let employees run all over you but listen to their needs a lot more such as taking breaks when asked, or food products when asked. There should be no such thing as an employee discount for someone that works for you. They should be getting those things for free because at the end of the day they're making those daily profits.
