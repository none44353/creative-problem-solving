3,"To begin I think that it is great that Becky has not continued to shoplift and is trying to get her life going in the right direction. In my life one of the quotes that I go by is ""watch the company that you keep"" I go by this because the people that you urround yourself with will be the people that you begin to look to for such things as advice and comfort. If those people are not heading in the same direction as you are with your life then it could become a burden on your life and start to hold you backfrom your goals. Becky's first problem is associating herself with someone who is continuously making the same mistake that she made by shoplifting. One solution that could work would be for Becky to sit down with Jim and rationally explain to him that wht he is doing is wrong and is not only hurting the store but in the long run could really hurt him, even if he thinks that he will never get caught. The manager of the Pizzeria has to know that Becky and Jim live together and since Becky already has a pas with shoplifting her manager will automatically connect her with the missing pizzas. If talking to Jim about it does not work then the next best thing to do in my opinion would be to either go to the manager and just let him know that you have been noticng that the stock for the pizzas has been decreasing and your not sure where the stock has been going to, so then the manager can look into it. Bringing it to his attention would clear up your name because you were honest. Or another thing you could do wold be to notify the manager that you do know for sure someone has been stealing pizzas but you do not know who it is, that way the manager can address the issue to the whole staff, leave the fact that you informed him out of it and then hopefully that woud give Jim a good enough reason to stop.

9,"Solution- A situation like this would be very hard on any one, Becky needs to look back on her life and reflect on where she is coming from and make the right decision of informing Mark about what's going on with Jim. However Mark decides to deal with it s not her concern. If Jim is not able to pay his rent thats not her business either. As a friend, as harsh as it may seem Becky would be doing the right thing. Jim would be able to learn from his mistakes if things turn out badly, where as he lost his jobor home or even both and understand that he was wrong and move on from that aspect of his life. Time is key in this situation because only time would help Jim and Becky's friendship if it goes downhill. Time, in order for him to understand. By helping heremployer's business, if Jim cant pay his part of the rent after, maybe Mark would be more generous in helping Becky out after such an ordeal.

25,"Becky should first discuss this with Jim, and tell him that he needs to either pay for the pizzas or he needs to go to the boss, and admit what he has done.  He will get caught in the end because eventually the ingredients will be missed.  The boss may unerstand, and perhaps will allow him to work off the pizzas somehow.  Maybe he could help out cleaning up around the restaurant.  If Jim will not tell his boss Becky should tell him.  She wouldn't necessarily have to come right out and tell on her coworker she could come up with a way for the boss to catch him at it.  If he does it once Jim will more than likely do it again.  She could tell the boss to check on the inventory.  She could have other people who might have been at the party come tell her boss bout it.

It actually probably only really bothers her becuase she doesn't want him to get caught and get fired becuase then he wouldn't be able to pay the other partof the rent.  What she should do is convince jim that she over heard Mark talking on the phone to the store manager about how they are about to install small security cameras in the ceiling so they're completely unnoticable becuase Mark has noticed a shor in supplies.  By doing this, Becky will hopefully scare Jim into not stealing from the pizzaria anymore without getting on his bad side.

34,"I believe that Becky needs to worry about herself first and foremost. If Becky's manager finds out that she knew all along about Jeff and did not say or do anything, she could be in trouble as well, and she already has a mark on her record, and her boss s trusting her to be more responsible. She needs to prove that she has changed and is a better person. Since Becky is so worried about Jeff making his rent, I think that first, Becky should tell Jeff what he's doing is wrong. She should warn him that if h does not change she will tell their boss, Mark about everything. Another option Becky should use is helping Jeff to find another job so he can still pay his rent, and persuade him that the right thing to do is to fess up to their boss. If their boss doesnot accept Jeff's honesty and apology, he may be fired, so he should have another job lined up. Becky should tell Mark she knew about Jeff's actions and is the one that persuaded him to come forward. If Becky does not do anything to stop this, the busines, as well as her job could be in jeopardy.

That way when the boss knows what happened and confronts Jim with the proble he can say that the he checks security tapes and that no one told him about what happened he figured out by himself.

46,"The first thing I would do is talk to Jim and explain what a bad situation his actions are putting her in.  If he still doesn't stop she should tell, if for no other reason than to cover her butt.  She is worried that Jim may get fired and not be able to ay his part of the rent, but if the boss thinks she is involved then she will get fired too.  Since she had such a hard time getting a job and this person has been so kind to her, she wouldn't want him to think that she was ungrateful or that she was steaing.  If Jim did get fired or didn't want to be her friend, it would be easier for her to find a roommate to take over for him, than it would be for her to find a new job and move out of her place.  She would then be forced to breark a lease which would b more money that she didn't have if she lost her job.

48,"One suggestion for Becky would be confronting Jim about her problem and concern before talking to Mark.  If Jim's behavior is effecting the way she can do her job she should tell him.  Also, with him being a good friend and her roomate she may want to tel him that she does not approve of his work ethic in a concerned friend way.  Jim needs to know that him stealing pizza is making her uncomfortable.  Maybe by expressing her concern to Jim it would get him to stop.  If Jim were to have a problem with her cncern, then maybe he would need to find another job.  It may not be healthy for them to be roomates and work together.  Becky should also let Jim know that him stealing pizza could also cost her the job also.  Having one roomate out of work for a brief peiod of time would be better than both of them losing their jobs.  If Jim continues with his behavior Becky should then tell Mark.

Since the boss has been doing her a favor by giving her that job, she needs to do it well and do him a favor when he is being taken advantage of.

As a manager maybe he can cut Jims hours, or only allow him to work when he is there. Or maybe give Jim a special task, for exmple doing inventory, that way he could get caught in his lies. Becky could also decide to move into a cheaper apartment, that way she doesn't have to worry about Jims half of the rent. Jim could get a different job.

However, she must bring this to him lightly and not ""lose"" him as a friend.If Jim will not confront Mark Becky needs to do the RIGHT thing and tell Mark what has been going on at the Pizzeria. It is her duty to be loyal to her boss, he was very kind and gave her the job in the first place. She could possibly set up a meeting wit JIm and Mark and come up with an idea that makes them all happy. For example: JIm will work to pay for the pizza he stole, but a new discount will be put in place like Becky and Jim are allowed to take a pizza home with them at night or eat it during ther lunch break without a cost. This way Jim will hopefully not feel the obligation to steal anymore and Backy has created a positive solution for what he has done.

Although friendships can be close, a friend wouldn't put a real friend in a situation that thy had to chose between the two.

If Marks finds that out that Jim is stealing the food then he would ask him to leave the job or may be would file an complaint to the polce. Becky should try every possible way to prevent Jim from stealing the food without spoiling her relationship with him. She should also describe the consequences if he get caught such as: police complaint following arrest, record on SSN, no respect in te society, and above all Mark would lose his faith on Becky  being Becky is Jim's friend. That would not make good impression on the any future employer and no one would like to hire them for any position.Becky should also warn that if Jim does not listento her, the she will have to report this Mark. and she might end up losing their friendship.

If this conversation does not change Jim's behavior and he continues to steal the food then Becky should report this to Mark. That might hurt Jim but Mark willbe glad and that will increase his faith on Becky. Becky woild also save her job and might also get prize from Mark for her honesty.

156,"Becky I believe should confront Jim and tell him how his stealing is not just hurting the pizzaria and Jim's potential future there, but is also endangering Becky's future because of her shoplifting history.  She can be blamed for the theft, and herself b fired for actions she did not do.  Perhaps this perspective of the situation would cause a change in Jim's actions. If it does not, Becky may wish to re-evaluate her roomate situation because he does not care for her well-being.  As a last resort at workshe may approach her boss with the situation about stealing the pizzas, and since Jim has several issues at work besides the stealing, she may ask Mark to use those reasons as ones given to him for him being fired, and therefore preventing some of the awkardness that might ensue if he thought the reason he was fired was Becky ""ratting"" her out.  It would be much easier for Jim to get a new job than Becky, since Becky has a shoplifting history and to our knowledge Jim does not.  Becky should carefully consder that when deciding to cover for her roomate's actions.

227,"First of all, Becky should have talked to Jim much earlier regarding his inappropriate behavior. However, since she allowed the situation to elaborate, she should first give Jim a brief chance to make it up by having him pay for the pizzas. If he does, i is a win-win for Becky since she gets to keep her job, her roommate = half the rent, without having to worry about hurting her relationship with Mark.

However, if Jim refuses to pay, she can either try to a) blackmail him or b) go straight to Mark. Blckmailing may put Becky at risk since she already has a record of shoplifting, especially if there is no evidence that Jim took the pizzas himself. If Becky goes and tells Mark right away, she will be able to preserve her long standing relationship with hm and prove to him that her ""criminal"" past is really behind her. However, since Jim will probably lose his job, given his problematic work behavior at the pizzeria, he will most likely be unable to pay his half of the rent or simply move out altogether.

If Becky does not find a suitable roommate quickly, she will be forced to temporary go into debt. In Becky's case this would be the lesser of two evils, since if she simply stays quite about the case she is being entirely unfair to Mark; and is also at isk of multiple negative consequences such as, her losing the job and further hurting her chances of getting a new one.

286,"1.) Becky should tell Mark of Jim's behavior, but she also needs to explain her situation at home and with her jobs. This way, Mark understands that Becky needs Jim to keep his job to be able to pay for rent, but she has also done the ""right"" thing and sh has protected herself from withholding information from her boss. Doing so could lead to Becky not being able to acquire the shift manager position (and i'm assuming the higher position would result in increased pay), or Mark could even fire her as it wold appear they were working together to steal the food(assuming Mark found out about the theft). This way it would be up to Mark to make a decision, and out of Becky's hands. 
2.) Mark could tell Jim that a customer (or even a ""secret shopper"") had repored the stealing of the pizza, saving Becky's friendship with Jim, as he may not know it was her. He could then reduce Jim's work hours, as punishment, or could put Jim on the ""3-strikes-and-you're-out"" warning system. If this is the first time Jim has bee in trouble, then he has time to mend his attitude and to think about the consequences. If Jim is on a second account of mischief, then a written warning could suffice. Lastly, if Jim is on his third strike, and there is no other option other than to fireJim, Mark could suspend Jim for a number of days or weeks as punishment also. If the last option is to fire Jim, Mark could inform Jim that he has (# of weeks) to find a different job, and he could also tell Becky that she has that much time to find a diferent roommate if that's what she wishes.

She needs to tell him that he is not doing well at the pizzeria and warn him that if he does not fix his working habits he will be fired. He needs to change his attitude with th costumers, concentrate when taking orders, and most definitely stop stealing. She needs to explain her story to him and let him know how hard it was for her to find this job and that it is going great for her. that she does not want to be blamed for whathe did. After all they are room mates and friends, so he must have some compassion for her. 
However If Jim does not change she should then go to Mark. She should honestly tell him about the stealing incident and that the last thing she wants is to rat hr friend out, but she doest want to be blamed for something she did not do. She should tell him that she has already spoke to Jim about not stealing again and having an over all better attitude at work. That she does not want her friend to lose her job no does she want to lose her friend. By doing this she has been a good employee as well as friend. She has left the situation on Mark's hands, because she already did all she could.

Give it to them as their next assignment.  Tell them, literally, “ Your jobs depend on what you come up with.” The reason you will do this is so that the engineers will not have time to contact a headhunter because they are so concerned with making a plan that will work.  They will be more productive because you are giving them something to really care about.  If the engineers reach a solution that is feasible, (which most likely they will) give them 7% raises instead of 6% raises as a job well done & boost  their egos a bit by telling them you need them to help the company succeed.  Overall, you increase productivity & keep your quality set of engineers.

Once hooked, the long-term deal will probably even out and may be less attractive in the long haul. The key to solving the problem is increasing employee satisfaction and putting the responsibility for success upon the employee themselves.  I would suggest an incentive-based program be implemented that way, Acme’s and the engineers goal become the same.  The success and profitability of the company.  It might also instill some competition among the engineers ie. The engineer who make the most money for the company and help increase productivity would reap an incentive for their efforts.

Even though the company (CEO/Management) would have to absorb the initial cost of profit sharing through year end bonuses or given during the time of salary increase, the benefits would include higher productivity/moral for the employees because if the company does well, they fair well. Once productivity is increased, more product is produced. The more product that is produced, the more materials that will be needed, increasing shipping will make it more likely that Acme can strike a deal with the shippers for a lower cost in exchange for more business for the shippers.

If the above research shows that the price can not be increased, and the true cause f turnover and decreased productivity is an employee perception that there are better opportunities else where, upper management is either going to have to increase engineerings perception of there jobs in a way that doesn’t cost anything (Friday afternoons off, or casual dress code) or increase salaries and sell product as a loss until something else changes.

464,"Turnovers are very bad for companies, especially if you spend time and money to train them.  There could be multiple reasons for their engineers leaving them besides wage. Environment could be one, if you don’t like where they work, first chance out and they leave.  Benefits and incentives could help out the situation. Like 401K, health plan, dental plan. Incentives, such as causal day, free dinners, or vacation time. Another consideration is to ask why your employees are leaving. Usually it is a lot of little things that sum up to it. If a person want to take another job, you already lost them. Another issue is the increase in expenses. Maybe a more realistic approach is to increase the price of their product.  Then they could keep the wage increase incentive. There is so many open choices and hard to cut the source of the problem.  Being in a real situation would help a lot more.

I personally don’t find much hope in the possibility of maintaining a quality group of workers at high level of productivity. I think the idea to reduce product costs initially was a good way to try to boost sales and competition in the job market, but the wage increase would be tough to conclude. If anything, I think in order to decrease the cost of shipping materials”, Acme should receive less shipped items, b/c how much of everything they receive do they actually use all of? Maybe a conclusion that could solve the problem of also having a surplus of products could be to use everything they have now and just receive shipment when they have ran out.

The employees deserve to have their pay checks before they start hiring other for the job.  For the product they had to raise it twice to cover the shipping process so yes they probably has lost some competition to the buyers who go for the cheapest product but the product might not be very good for quality. So if you raised the product on the marker and you know the product is definitely quality then the buyers will prefer better quality of the product and they will pay more for the gets the job done. Once the company makes the money of their better product then they will be able to afford to give their employees a higher % wage for the job and hours they are getting.

559,"Clara is a busy student as well as a part time worker. I suggest that she works in between class breaks. In addition, best way to work around her classes is to work before her day starts with class or after school when she's finally done with classes. Therefore, when she gets home, she can use her time to work on her homework/ assignments. She must make sure her schedule doesnt conflict with her sleep, daily routine as well as family time. So she must make sure she follows a routine that's best suitable for her. For instance, Clara has class at 10 a.m, she will work the few hours from 7:30 am-9:30 am if she choose then use the 30 mins int between to get to class in time and relax for a bit. Lets say she's done for the day at 5 pm. She will work 5 p.m-8 p.m. Therefore, out of the 5 days a week of school, she is already getting approximately 25 hrs. In addition, she may also work weekends. Thus, she can rearrange the hours and adjusting the hours around to suit her best when it comes down to tough weeks such as preparations for exams etc and lastly, she will have enough time at night to finish her homework and half days of her weekends with family and friends.     Best option I would do if school offers her required classes in a two or three days a week, take that and she'll be happier than attending a 5 school days. Clara can then manage more free time and less stress on how to come up with money for GAS!

I used to work at a place where whenever I had the chance I was able to work on homework. Sacrificing is part of the game, her grades are very important, so if it comes between having ""extra money"" or going to med school, she needs to decide which one is more important.

The last option I would sugest for Clara would to be look for another job, such as receptionist or such, to occupy less of her time and maybe she could take some of her homework to her job if they were not as busy or her needs were not that demanding.

665,"Clara's current job is obviously problematic and her 15 hour credit load is only one class above the 12 credit minimum to qualify as a full-time student.  As such she could drop at most one class before she loses any financial aid that requires her to be full-time.  This brings about the only practical solution: changing her work schedule.  While Clara has openly stated she does not want to quit her job because it pays well and because she enjoys the work, her job is doing nothing to further her career and is in fact hampering it.    In many fields, a student working towards his or her degree can find paying internships at companies that employ people in the student's field of study.  Sometimes these jobs are no more glorified than Clara's current gopher job but at least a job that places her around medical professionals will give Clara a better view of what her future could look like.  Depending upon the company and job description of the internship, the hours Clara works could be very flexible meaning she could work just a few hours a week when final exams come up but a full 40 hours over Spring Break if she really wants the extra money.  Also, an internship could greatly increase Clara's chance of getting a full time job at the company after she complete school.    As for the financial aspect of this solution there is much speculation and few hard facts.  The definition of Clara's problem did not state if she was fully dependent upon her income or if she has any financial reserves to draw upon.  If she needs a job to pay her monthly bills and does not have a few months worth of expenses in savings, she obviously cannot just quit her job and hope for the best which makes transitioning between her current job and the proposed internship problematic.  A short term loan from Mom and Dad may solve this problem or she may need to apply for a loan from some form of a financial institution.  If Clara has been financially responsible she should have several months worth of rent and other expenses in her savings and she can use these funds to manage the switch between jobs.    In short, Clara needs an internship type job in a relevant industry where she can learn more about the career she is working towards.  Provided she has cash reserves and such jobs exist in the field she want to work in she should quit her job soon to increase her chances of successfully completing her classes.  Even if it takes a few months for her to secure an internship, the benefits of a educationally relevant job far outweigh the cost of the temporary depletion of her savings funds.

In the case that she doesn't need the job I would suggest that even though she loves it her future is more important so she should consider quitting or finding a less demanding job. If she needs the money than the job she is at is good because it pays well with less than full time hours so her current job is better for her than one that requires 40 hours to make good money. Yes med-school is her goal but she has to consider the bills to be payed and learn to compormise with both school and work.

If her employer would permit it, working 15 hours a week could allow her five hours more study time for each of the classes she is getting ""C's"" in.    This isn't so much a creative solution as a practical and realistic one. Student loans are inevitable for most people, particuarly with any thought to medical school. Any debt incurred from her undergraduate degree will be trumpted by loans for medical school.    Alternatively, I would recommend getting a different job that did provide her with practical experience which would be applicable and beneficial for her before medical school.

Instead of working 25 hours a week, she could work 15 hours a week, therefore having an equal school and class load.  Another idea is that Clara could talk to her bosses at work and ask if during down time at her job, she could work on homework.  Or, Clara could look into somehow possibly getting extra credit in her pre-med courses by doing some kind of study at work.  Maybe she, with permission of her co-workers, could do some kind of study about the amount of sleep an employee receives verses their work performace that day.  Or a study about the types of food, or nutrients the employee takes in that day verses their performance.  Clara needs to look for ways such as these to not only balance work and school, but to also help the two to help each other. She needs to work hard, but also work smart.

This could provide Clara with practical experience because she will be learning about the special needs and medical care of older adults (in addition to developing and improving on interpersonal skills and ""bedside"" manner). Also, most senior citizens who require home health care/caregiving are willing to negotiate hours that will fit with their schedules and the caregiver's schedules (which will allow for Clara to have more time to study). Clara could also apply for financial aid (grants and loans) and scholarships to help pay for school. As far as school is concerned, Clara needs to set up a schedule for when she needs to study.

Her current job as a ""gopher"" at an architectural design firm may seem to be of high importance at the moment, given that she needs money to pay for school, gas, food, and bills; but looking at her goals from a longterm perspective is a better way to help reprioritize her schedule. Because Clara is not receiving any practical experiences from her current job, I believe cutting down some of her work hours is an important sacrifice to be made for her future profession in the medical field. If the company does not allow Clara to cut her hours, she should consider looking for a more flexible job, in which she is given the option to work around her school hours and study time. She can also try to use better time management of studying more efficiently if she decides keeping her job at the designer firm is absolutely necessary to get by financially. This can be done by sacrificing other activities that Clara might enjoy engaging in, such as using the weekends to catch up on school materials. She can also collaborate with her classmates and attend some helpful tutoring sessions, which might help her better understand her difficult courses with a different perspective/ approach.

A hospital requires 12 hour shifts so you could schedule 2 12 hour shifts to get good pay and still have the rest of the week's free hours for study and relaxation.  Nursing homes usually require 8 hour shifts but are also very flexible with schedules.

890,"It sounds like Clara's present job is the lesser of two evils at the moment. Since she enjoys it, and she most likely needs the money for school fees, she can't drop the job completely. However, she should first talk with her employers to make her work schedule fit efficiently around her other activities. Whether that pans out or not, at the very least, Clara will feel like she's taken a step in the right direction. Being a ""gopher"" does not sound mentally-taxing. If Clara can cover new material in what little study time she has, she can confirm the knowledge through maintenance rehearsal on the job. Mental reviewing and repeating what she knows and remembers will limit what she has to go over later. Finding connections between her work activities and class material will help her find ways to review it at work and have something to refer back to during exams and study sessions. Clara could also ask her coworkers to chip in, maybe asking each to memorize a single fact (not anything large or demanding) that she needs to know from the current lesson. Every time she sees him/her, Clara would have to correctly repeat back the fact. A well-maintained schedule would also be necessary, of course. Another option would be to quit the architectural design firm and find a job that is more suited to her field, limiting the different kinds of knowledge she'd be faced with every day (architecture and pre-med aren't exactly identical), meaning less interference. It would also give her a taste for her future.

With the work load getting harder and the need to receive good grades being a major factor she has to put the majority of energy into schooling. I would suggest she speak with the firm she is working for to see if they could cut her hours during semesters and up them in during the breaks. If they are unable to meet her needs then it is no longer a working relationship and she needs to make some changes. She would need to find employment that fits with her schedule. I good place to start would be work from home solutions such as becoming an Independent contractor where she can choose her own hours and potentially make a lot of money without putting in the long hours - and can work between school and studying. She should use her breaks between semesters to submit applications for grants and scholarships to help her financially, she could also explore loans to help with the cost of living. If her grades are not good enough to qualify for grants and/or scholarships then that she become a goal for her to raise her grades to be able to qualify in the future.

918,"Clara works as a ""gopher"" less than 5 hours a day on the average; maybe Clara could actually try ""studying"" for a change, maybe even ""paying attention"" in class.  That'd be the most practical, efficient, energy-conserving, cost-effective way to go.  But if she really wants to go all out for the sake of creativity, she could join or organize a study group with active participation quizzes, which she herself could come up with, inventing new and creative ways of thinking about class subjects.  But if she really wanted to be creative, she could consider the fact that if that work ""load"" was too much for her to handle she really ought to start coming up with new ideas for a ""career"" other than being a doctor, in which case it could be possible that life and death situations would rely on her ability to do what she's expected to do, and come up with resourceful, practical ways to do it - which apparently she doesn't seem to be cut out for on her own.

1021,"Personally, I think that Clara should drop the pre-med major and go for one in architectural design since she likes her job, but it doesn't appear like she wants to do that.  First of all, Clara needs to plan out how she's going to go to work and study during her weeks/weekends.  I would suggest that she work as much as possible during the weekend so that she can get some of her 25 hours/week out of the way.  Say that she works seven hours a say on Saturday and Sunday, Clara would have 14 out of her 25 hours already done.  Now all she has left to work during her week is 11 hours.  She could split those hours up so that her schedule looked like this:  Monday - school, work for 4 hours, study  Tuesday - school, no work, spend the time that you now have from not working for studying  Wednesday - school, work for 4 hours, study  Thursay - school, no work, spend the time that you now have from not working for studying  Friday - school, work for 3 hours, study (since she only has to work 3 days on Friday, Clara could have an hour of free time - YAY!)  Clara also needs to make sure that there are as little distractions as possible when she's studying so that she can make the most out of her study time.  And that's how I would solve Clara's problem!  :)

If that is not an option either, than it would be better to consider looking for another job and possibly taking out some loans to help her in the mean time. Maybe she can take a position else where with fewer hours but similar pay.

If shipping costs have become an issue, perhaps the first thing to do would be to explore other shipping options. See if anything is cheaper on the market. If that doesn't make a difference, then perhaps it would be wise to apply a shipping fee for the resources used to ship products to their customers. Otherwise, unless you have extremely loyal engineers, you will most likely keep losing engineers due to ""better"" incentives. Perhaps they would consider opening a 401K plan for their employees or a college plan for their children.

Keeping the wage increases down to keep product price down is a good idea, but in practice, if you lose your best engineers to other companies then the company cannot remain competitive anyway. There are other ways to cut costs, either by having less engineers working for the company or by providing those that do the best work with the higher wage increases.

1085,"Acme Corporation needs to start with employee surveys. Finding out why workers are dissatisfied with their current job and why other companies employment opportunities are better would be helpful. Acme may not be able to compete with everything their competitors are doing to satisfy their employees, but even trying to compete in a couple ways could really make a difference. Worker benefits would be another way to keep employees happy. An example would be paid time off (PTO) that they could accumulate after so many days and hours worked that they didn't call in sick or that the employees were working efficiently. PTO could be cheaper than bonuses because there would have to be a incentive to get it and not everyone will work to get it. Other little things management could do is even something as simple as a food Friday, just providing a meal for employees or having a potluck. Little things show workers that their employees care make them feel important and noticed leaving them satisfied which makes them want to perform their job better to impress their bosses. One last idea, instead of a normal Christmas bonus which could cost the company hundreds of dollars, a little gift for each employer would be much cheaper! On that note, Acme company should look outside employment problems to figure out how to make more of a profit! Acme company might need to find a different shipping method or ship smarter to reduce that cost. Reduced shipping cost would equal more profit and more profit means more money for employees, happier employees equals better productivity which in turns equals better competition with competitors.

1111,"In order to maintain a high level of productivity without increasing the turnover rate of your engineers, I would ask you to consider laying off a handful of engineers. Now, this means to place them effectively in a different position, maybe speaking with some recruiters to help them be placed in a different location. After they have been let go, you can increase the level of pay to the highest quality of engineers that you kept on payroll. This will mean a moderate increase in the amount of work they will need to perform, but they should expect that increase with the increase in pay. This will ensure that the employees will stay with Acme, and become happier with wage increases. If necessary, after a six month period, if the employees are voicing concerns over the amount of work not being worth it even with the increase in pay, I would recommend adding external benefits.

To ask the engineers to keep up such a high productivity without earning the pay they deserve, it's unlikely.

For instance, when the money problems Acme is facing get taken care of, they take care of any debt, and become beyond stable,  they can begin to pay the engineers what they deserve.

1122,"I would attempt to increase opportunities at a low or no cost to acme.  Plenty of positive energy can be added to the workplace without excessive cost.  One idea would be to make a list of all the current opportunities offered to acme employees (especially things that other area employers don't offer); the point of this would be to help employees realize what they have now, rather than just what they could have at another company.  Many times people loose sight of this, a concrete reminder may be helpful.  As well, implementing a new program that increases positive energy may increase productivity as well as employee contentment.  If new signs were posted in common areas that included positive, encouraging, empowering, and compassionate stories, people may take the time to read them and feel better about themselves, their environment, and their employer.

In today's economy, holding onto a stable job is very important especially considering that we aren't letting these engineers go. There are many ways to keep these engineers happy and productive. One is to look at the big picture and years down the line. Is this a temporary set back? Do we have to take one step back in order to take two steps forward? We need to explain that to our engineers: this is a temporary set back (if that is indeed the truth). If we increase productivity, the wage increases will come somewhere down the line. Staying with Acme for the long run is the better road to take for these engineers rather than leaving Acme for a potential ""better"" job. I will be honest with our engineers and explain the situation to them. I will hide nothing for them and explain the reason behind the lack of a wage increase this year.

1139,"There are several changes that Acme could make to reduce the turnover rate of engineers at the company. Most can agree that money is frequently at the root one's dissatisfaction in their career. Although Acme is unable to provide a larger wage increase, they could try offering stock options or perhaps extra benefits (like gas benefits etc) There are also many affordable options that Acme should consider to reduce this turn over rate. It's rather simple: create a pleasant work environment. This is not in reference to everybody getting along, but appealing to the human brain's desire for an aesthetically pleasing environment. These changes can be subtle and still produce happier workers. Acme could start by changing the lighting in the working area of the engineers by removing dim lighting and avoiding fluorescent lighting. More color in the environment could improve the attitude of their engineers towards their job; paint the walls (avoid grey or cream colors), brighten up common/break rooms, get more colorful art etc. Try to open up the space of their working area; minimize cubicles. Also, plants in the work environment have been proven to increase productivity and create what is perceived to be a ""healthier"" environment. All of these aspects have been proven to create a satisfying and productive environment in the home or at work. Despite the fact that other companies can provide ""more benefits"" or a ""better job"", they will most likely fail to match our productive and pleasant work environment. The engineers spend a majority of their weekdays in their work environment, making the more likely to maintain their position with Acme. These adjustments are affordable and potentially extremely effective in reducing the turnover rate of engineers at Acme Company.

This would allow better productivity in areas if an engineer involved with less jobs than more. Also, limiting the amount of jobs would make for a decrease in the amount of ""better opportunities"" for engineers because they are trained in less of an abroad area and more specific.

1147,"Providing yearly bonuses to employees is a good way of keeping them going. I think a good idea would be to monitor each employee. Look for things like accuracy, knowledge of job, speed, etc. This will be what you base their wage increases and yearly bonuses on. This way, if someone is not working to their potential or to the expectations of the company, they will not get the full bonus or a pay increase. The employees who deserve it because of their high work ethic (especially regarding work quality and productivity level) will get the extra bonus and the ones who don't, won't. If you have a system that measures the previously listed suggestions (accuracy, etc.) then you can base it off of number results and favoritism won't be a factor either. Plus if they are not working up to the level they should be (set a level that they should be at by a certain time) it is a reason to find new employees to put in their place. All at the same time, the company should consider having fewer employees, but employees that have a good quality work ethic, can work fast, and increase levels of productivity. This way you are paying people that deserve it, but not so many people that it is costing too much money.

Acme needs to be honest with their staff, and tell them they are in a tight position right now, but hopefully the company will get through their tight spot when the economy starts to look up.  Acme may also want to have annual evaluation on the employee's work.  Those who are good workers, work well with others, get to work on time, etc. will have a higher pay raise than those who do not.  They need to have management or leaders keep records of this, instead of trying to remember throughout the time span to the next evaluation.  This will give the employees incentive to come and work hard at their job, which may help the increase in the product going out.

Also, having a liaison engineer work with the other engineers to find a solution and find what they want could be positive. Then, the liaison could speak to management and see what they can figure out.

For example to keep the attention from the workers they can have rewards such as PTO (paid time off) time after performing such tasks. Or they can have some fun activities such as bingo days.

Since their wages can't be increased, the solution needs to come in the form(s) of benefit improvements that are cost effective for Acme while genuinely improvements for the engineers. First, I would suggest getting rid of any company fees the engineers are now having to pay for: gym memberships, fuel costs for company cars, etc. Secondly, their work areas and equipment could be upgraded in areas where they feel the most need. If these upgrades and fee dismissals cost under a bottom line wage increase which could even be discussed; I would recommend implementing these measures soon. Also, more employee family fees for participation in outside activities such as the ones enjoyed by employees on premises here could be discussed with the engineers: YMCA memberships, etc. Just getting into discussions with the engineers about their situation could inspire more company loyalty from their group.

1156,"In order to retain and attain quality engineering talent Acme needs to review and formalize the following policies: / First, engineers are highly skilled professionals who deserve dignity in what is expected of them in the workplace. In order to foster this dignified environment Acme should consider flexible hours and the potential for telecommuting. The traditional 40 hour work week is a bit passe and not appropriate in today's technological environment. By allowing engineers the ability to get the job done according to a schedule that best works for them, we foster a greater work life balance and therefore have happier employees. This is not about 'butt in chair time,' it is about getting the job done and getting it done well. / The corporate culture at Acme should also be reviewed. Providing an open and honest environment that allows engineers to voice concerns without fear of repercussions is highly valued amongst employees. Also, management needs to be respectful of engineers as individuals; playing to our strengths and working to deflect potential conflicts so that we may do our jobs in a timely manner without having to deal with outside concerns. / Don't over-think the wage increase. We respect that the wage increase is extremely competitive in today's recessed economy. Instead, providing job stability, first class medical coverage, 401k match, and tuition reimbursement is greatly appreciated. Once we are established in our careers here it is much easier to stay with the management and coworkers we enjoy and understand. If Acme provides a sense of continuity for the engineering staff it will be easier for us to ignore recruiters and keep our focus on our projects at Acme. / Finally, make this a job my spouse loves. Make sure my benefits, my hours, and my stress level are congruent with my pay. Make sure I get the time off to go on my family vacation or enjoy my holidays. Because if my spouse likes Acme that means I don't feel pressure to leave this job when I'm at home. If you can keep my spouse happy, you keep me happy. (Note: telling me to stop bitching about my job when I get home is not an acceptable solution, per my meeting with the VP regarding this concern last year at this time.)

It would be a little difficult to offer more pay to our employees and keep the cost of the product down but it would seem that the only way to keep our labor group up is by either increasing the wage to the workers to an extent or by offering some kind of benefit to our employees which is both affordable to us and worthwhile for the workers. In my opinion, it may be a bit cheaper to offer more pay for the workers since more vacation time can cause less production and benefits such as health insurance and the like can become expensive, especially for the labor force this company manages. We may make less money doing this but in a company you have to put money in to get money out. We can't have a product without employees and without of product we cannot make any money.

Also, restrict our engineers from talking to these recruiters during work times and offer awards or benefits with high qualities of work.

Stock options are another way to get people to feel more committed and invested into the company.  Having a strong sense of pride on one's work is a powerful motivator to do better work.

With the upper management holding that wage increases should be held at 6% then I could see how the engineers would lose care and focus. Because they are working for a company that is more concerned with watching what their employees earn rather than going out and trying to get more projects to keep there business running and profiting. The old saying goes that if you're good at something, never do it for free. Which is what your employees are seeing. Why would they want to work here and know that they have no chance of expanding their pay grade past 6%? If another company offers a more lucrative deal to them and they are getting paid better and with more benefits than you should look at them and ask yourself ""what are they doing correctly that we aren't ?""

1184,"If the main concern is to maintain a quality group of engineers at a high level of productivity, then I feel as though it is important to make sure that the engineers are satisfied. It seems as though when they are dissatisfied that production tends to decrease and turnover in their position seems to increase. I feel as though you need to investigate what it is that is causing the engineer group to be so dissatisfied. It has been stated that Acme's policy on wage increases has added in to these harsh feelings from the engineer group. Then I would say that you should review what Acme's policy on wage increase is and possibly make some changes to this policy. I know that money is tight and that product costs are increasing. However, it does no good to hold wage increase and continue to lose quality workers and waste money on recruiting, training, and hiring. It may be more beneficial in the long run to release the hold and allow the workers to be happy. It is hard to run a company effectively and efficiently when they aren't any workers.

This way, the workers will not feel as though they are not being recognized, and can at the same time appreciate the company's interest in them as individuals who need their fair share of the profits of the company, not just as pawns in the company's game to make more money. In doing so, I believe productivity will increase, justifying wage increases, even if it is a little. Based upon doing subsequent research on the profit yielded from this method, the company could readjust the wage increases accordingly, even increasing them if their budget allows, rather than keeping the extra for profit. I think it would create a cycle of happier and more productive employees when they realize they are both necessary drivers of and have positive impacts on the company.

1212,"My suggestion to improve both the companies financial standing, and the wages of Acme engineers is to open up new material manufacturing and shipping locations. If financially plausible, this would provide the best return to the company over time by cutting the cost of both manufacturing and shipping product by reducing the amount of movement a product requires before it reaches the market. By reducing these shipping costs, over time the company will have a larger return and can increase the wages of Acme engineers. To combat this situation immediately, it may also be necessary to put some engineers in charge of the designing and building aspect of these manufacturing plants. This will keep engineers interested in their job by giving them some accountability for the success of the company, as well as a sense of pride for jobs because they know they are needed for such a specialized venture. While this doesn't' immediately solve the problem of reduced wage increases, being honest and straightforward with company employees about the situation will go a long way in keeping engineers content with their job. With the way the market is, people can understand that some companies need some time to turn themselves around and get back on their feet. If employees are notified of the smaller wage increases and projected future increases, they might be more willing to stick around in order to reap the rewards of an expanding, thriving company. As long as future wage projections are honest, there will be no reason for dissatisfaction or a decrease in productivity. Honesty is the key, and while some engineers may still be lost to other companies, it's very likely that many will hold their ground with a company that is very revealing and honest about its approach to business and how wages will be handled.

1213,"I think wage increases at a  6 percent level is fair and a little generous. Bottom achieving engineers shouldn't receive a 6 percent increase because their job performance doesn't reflect a raise. I would let them go if they found a better paying job because it's costing the company more money to keep them on  their current salary. I also believe that you need to reward the best employees that the company has. I think low turnover rate is important to the success of a company because a good company needs a veteran work force who has the confidence of the executive vice president. With there being an abundant of jobs available then there are a little of projects to be completed and you want your most qualified employees completing the projects. I think trying to reduce product is bad because the more product that is made then the better the company will look to outsiders. They can also not fill positions after someone has left and that will help keep the costs down. Or try and hire people and lower pay and that will also help.

Also the supervisors must very closely watch the way in which they speak to their employees for if they feel degraded they will be apt to leave.

To increase production, there should be an attempt to increase accountability of for the products produced.  Perhaps splitting the engineers into smaller ""teams"" and pairing them with small ""teams"" of other departments likes sales and advertising would make everyone take more pride in their work. This would be effective because then instead of trying to please management, everyone would be working to help each other out and for pride.

1226,"In order for Acme to maintain a quality group of engineers without giving them a raise might be hard to do. I suggest that instead of giving them a raise, make their work environment more enjoyable. You could maybe have longer lunch breaks, employee parties every so often, more paid vacation time. As long as these don't cost the company too much, if will most likely be cheaper than giving the employees raises. The recruiters can still say they have ""better"" jobs and ""better"" benefits, just the benefits wont be a raise, but instead a more enjoyable workplace. Acme could also try advertising their company and hopefully earn more business to combat the shipping costs of materials. They could also try to find the products they need locally instead of having them shipped. That could save a lot of money.

1228,"Acme Company cannot prevent other companies from enticing their employees away. What it CAN do is provide employees with incentive to stay in their current positions, rather than leave for another company. There are several ways in which I think that this could be improved.  /  / First, on the issue of wage increases. In an environment where there is such high demand for engineers, Acme Company cannot continue to pay their engineers less than all of their competition. Neither can it most likely afford to raise wages higher than the competition. What I would propose would be a wage increase across the board from 6 percent to 8-9 percent per year, with incentive bonuses given for individual performance and for the overall group completing certain pre-defined objectives. Because this wage increase will still probably not be comparable to what is being offered at other companies, Acme Company should review it's policies to see if there are ways in which they can make their employees feel more cared-for. Ideas in this area could include: 1) Review of current insurance coverage, and attempts to obtain better coverage for employees; 2) Providing in-house day care services for employees; 3) Sponsoring various activities, such as a (mildly) competitive bowling league, game nights or instituting an occasional company outing at a restaurant or bar; 4) Creation of an anonymous suggestion box, where employees can inform management of grievances or can provide the company with new ideas to streamline processes within the company; 5) Provide small incentives, like movie passes or gift cards for attendance and performance on a smaller scale. 6) Improve and update equipment and workspace areas where possible (better chairs is always a good place to start - businesses usually have TERRIBLE chairs for employees); 7) Look into the possibility of allowing more flexibilities in work schedules, so as to allow employees to better balance work and home commitments. One area in which this could be implemented is to allow employees who perform adequately to work from home one day per week.  /  / The bottom line is that Acme needs to provide an environment that employees WANT to be in, otherwise, they will search for greener pastures.

When advertising for positions at Acme, stress not only the salary, but that the employee would be fulfilling a need to society, that they are valued and wanted. Tell them that the facilities are state of the art, the managers are very supportive and constructive, and they will be an important contribution to a worthwhile cause.

If it is a real problem to increase wages, then definitely make sure the benefits are very good.  If the engineers are happy, they will want to do their job more, and productivity should remain high.

The main thing you need to focus on is finding a way to reduce shipping costs without raising the price of the product.  -- Ship out bigger loads and less at a time. Another thing to focus on is cutting costs in any other way. One thing that could be done to cut costs somewhere else is to buy less quality material, but the bad thing about that is it would not be fair to the customers, which isn't good for them or us.  When you sit down and talk with the engineers you need to explain to them that you should not have said there would be wage increases in the first place. You should explain that they will receive it in the future when things get better with the company.  Make the engineers feel like they are valued and respected at this company.  Also, explain the wage miscommunication won't happen again in the future-- if you a loyal to you employers, they are more likely to me loyal to your company.

Deciding to have a serious discussion with him is not a bad idea and, if done without harshness (but with enough assertiveness), it can help the situation. Becky isconflicted, and her explaining that to Jim is important. Jim needs to know how much Mark has helped her out, and that Mark gave her a chance because he saw she needed one. If she explains her responsiility to Mark now because of all that he's done for herover the past three years, he may understand the extent to which the job matters. Becky must also be assertive, though, and demand that Jim do his job and improve within a short amount of time because letting Mark down is not an option. And, if he doesn'tmake the appropriate changes within the next pay period (or whatever she feels necessary), she'll be looking for a new roommate. Regardless of being friends, if he can't pay the rent, it won't matter. She won't be able to keep him as an employee if he doen't start to improve his work performance.

After this interaction, try to get Mark to watch over Jim slightly and ask Mark to talk about Jim's behaviors with him respectfully, with an open minded attitude, and not throw around threats of firing him or anything like that. The end result, due to proper communication and appropriate manners on both Mark and Becky's side is that Jim and Mark find a common ground (i.e. Jim can take one free pizza per week).

2021,"PLAN A: Have a nice one-on-one conversation with Jim, and mention to him that the apartment is extremely important. Then go on to state that stealing the pizzas is a completely irresponsible thing to do, and she does NOT want to get Jim fired, but she feels the need to tell Mark. Say ""however, I know if I speak to Mark, he will fire you, Jimbo. But we can't afford that, so I have to let this one slide. I think I will anonymously mention to Mark that we need more security cameras in the store.""
PLAN B: Becky knows that Jim took the pizzas, so that means the store is missing supplies. This means that she could easily tell Mark supplies are missing, and that someone must have stolen them during their shift BECAUSE they were understaffed and could not oversee the freezers as well. This would force Mark to either hire more employees and suspect nothing, or it would cause him to increase security precautions in the store and leave Jim unharmed. After more employees are hired (if they were hired) tell Mark the truth, and get Jim fired. Make him get a different job, but never tell Jim that Becky told Mark.

Now, I would recommend Mark address Jims behavior by telling him that his actions have consequences and that hes implemented new rules to address the recent issues hes been noticing in the work place. I suggest Mark take off from Jims paycheck everytime he steals from the job (also I suggest he find out how much their rent is from Becky so that he knows how much is too much to take away so he can still make rent). I also recommend that Mark tell Jim that everytime he is rude to a customer he has to clock out and calm down (clocking out = not getting paid).

For example, and email exchange at the beginning of the week asking for a task list would help to clarify things significantly. It is also possible that her perspective is skewed, and other students that have worked on the project have struggled with these same issues and have found solutions, but do not show their discontent because it is not socially acceptable.

2734,"I believe Joan should first make a pros and cons list and see if it is even worth staying in this research program. If the cons outweigh the pros, I believe she should format a professional email to Dr. Bundt letting him know that she is not interested in the research that hes doing and while shes enjoyed her time there she believes a student who is much more interested in the research may give him more promising results. If she ends up coming up with more pros than cons, I suggest she finds a way to make the research more enticing. I would first recommend that she take time to thoroughly plan out each day of her week so that way she has more time to get everything done without being too overwhelmed. In regards to making it more enticing, I think she should first try and get more involved with the other people in her research group who seem to be enjoying their time. Maybe they are bringing something to the table she isnt and it could completely alter her thoughts on the program. In regards to Dr. Bundt being a very unfriendly and difficult to please person, I recommend she does what he says the way he says it and move on. It is clear that he has his own things going on and it is not your job to please him but instead to assist in research. Even though it may be unpleasesent, its part of life and usually taking as much distance as you can between the both of you may improve your experience.

2875,"It seems like the problem is based on incentives. Since there is more incentive to work at other companies (mainly money), the engineer decides in his or her interest to switch jobs to a more profitable one.

Outside of money, a worker is also satisfied if he has an opportunity to grow and eventually create something for themselves in the future. For a worker to stay at a company that pays less money, he has to be satisfied working there. The satisfaction could come from a modern workspace with one-of-a-kind equipment, providing bonuses to people that come up with ideas to improve the product, create a weekly schedule that is based on a four-day workweek. (studies in Finland have shown that a four-day workweek is more productive than a five-day workweek, even though the workers spend less time on a problem.)

If a worker has a family and he gets the opportunity to only work four days instead of five for the same amount of money, he will reconsider if the extra money from the other job is worth considering.

Acme can target a certain age group for hiring practices such as teenagers. Most teenagers do not need a job to live more so just to have their own money. They must also give these teenagers flexible schedules and lots of work benefits. That doesn't mean let employees run all over you but listen to their needs a lot more such as taking breaks when asked, or food products when asked. There should be no such thing as an employee discount for someone that works for you. They should be getting those things for free because at the end of the day they're making those daily profits.
