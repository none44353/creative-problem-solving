3,"To begin I think that it is great that Becky has not continued to shoplift and is trying to get her life going in the right direction. In my life one of the quotes that I go by is ""watch the company that you keep"" I go by this because the people that you urround yourself with will be the people that you begin to look to for such things as advice and comfort. If those people are not heading in the same direction as you are with your life then it could become a burden on your life and start to hold you backfrom your goals. Becky's first problem is associating herself with someone who is continuously making the same mistake that she made by shoplifting. One solution that could work would be for Becky to sit down with Jim and rationally explain to him that wht he is doing is wrong and is not only hurting the store but in the long run could really hurt him, even if he thinks that he will never get caught. The manager of the Pizzeria has to know that Becky and Jim live together and since Becky already has a pas with shoplifting her manager will automatically connect her with the missing pizzas. If talking to Jim about it does not work then the next best thing to do in my opinion would be to either go to the manager and just let him know that you have been noticng that the stock for the pizzas has been decreasing and your not sure where the stock has been going to, so then the manager can look into it. Bringing it to his attention would clear up your name because you were honest. Or another thing you could do wold be to notify the manager that you do know for sure someone has been stealing pizzas but you do not know who it is, that way the manager can address the issue to the whole staff, leave the fact that you informed him out of it and then hopefully that woud give Jim a good enough reason to stop.

So she must make sure she follows a routine that's best suitable for her.

Lets say she's done for the day at 5 pm. She will work 5 p.m-8 p.m. Therefore, out of the 5 days a week of school, she is already getting approximately 25 hrs. In addition, she may also work weekends. Thus, she can rearrange the hours and adjusting the hours around to suit her best when it comes down to tough weeks such as preparations for exams etc and lastly, she will have enough time at night to finish her homework and half days of her weekends with family and friends.

665,"Clara's current job is obviously problematic and her 15 hour credit load is only one class above the 12 credit minimum to qualify as a full-time student.  As such she could drop at most one class before she loses any financial aid that requires her to be full-time.  This brings about the only practical solution: changing her work schedule.  While Clara has openly stated she does not want to quit her job because it pays well and because she enjoys the work, her job is doing nothing to further her career and is in fact hampering it.    In many fields, a student working towards his or her degree can find paying internships at companies that employ people in the student's field of study.  Sometimes these jobs are no more glorified than Clara's current gopher job but at least a job that places her around medical professionals will give Clara a better view of what her future could look like.  Depending upon the company and job description of the internship, the hours Clara works could be very flexible meaning she could work just a few hours a week when final exams come up but a full 40 hours over Spring Break if she really wants the extra money.  Also, an internship could greatly increase Clara's chance of getting a full time job at the company after she complete school.    As for the financial aspect of this solution there is much speculation and few hard facts.  The definition of Clara's problem did not state if she was fully dependent upon her income or if she has any financial reserves to draw upon.  If she needs a job to pay her monthly bills and does not have a few months worth of expenses in savings, she obviously cannot just quit her job and hope for the best which makes transitioning between her current job and the proposed internship problematic.  A short term loan from Mom and Dad may solve this problem or she may need to apply for a loan from some form of a financial institution.  If Clara has been financially responsible she should have several months worth of rent and other expenses in her savings and she can use these funds to manage the switch between jobs.    In short, Clara needs an internship type job in a relevant industry where she can learn more about the career she is working towards.  Provided she has cash reserves and such jobs exist in the field she want to work in she should quit her job soon to increase her chances of successfully completing her classes.  Even if it takes a few months for her to secure an internship, the benefits of a educationally relevant job far outweigh the cost of the temporary depletion of her savings funds.

These changes can be subtle and still produce happier workers. Acme could start by changing the lighting in the working area of the engineers by removing dim lighting and avoiding fluorescent lighting. More color in the environment could improve the attitude of their engineers towards their job; paint the walls (avoid grey or cream colors), brighten up common/break rooms, get more colorful art etc. Try to open up the space of their working area; minimize cubicles. Also, plants in the work environment have been proven to increase productivity and create what is perceived to be a ""healthier"" environment.

1156,"In order to retain and attain quality engineering talent Acme needs to review and formalize the following policies: / First, engineers are highly skilled professionals who deserve dignity in what is expected of them in the workplace. In order to foster this dignified environment Acme should consider flexible hours and the potential for telecommuting. The traditional 40 hour work week is a bit passe and not appropriate in today's technological environment. By allowing engineers the ability to get the job done according to a schedule that best works for them, we foster a greater work life balance and therefore have happier employees. This is not about 'butt in chair time,' it is about getting the job done and getting it done well. / The corporate culture at Acme should also be reviewed. Providing an open and honest environment that allows engineers to voice concerns without fear of repercussions is highly valued amongst employees. Also, management needs to be respectful of engineers as individuals; playing to our strengths and working to deflect potential conflicts so that we may do our jobs in a timely manner without having to deal with outside concerns. / Don't over-think the wage increase. We respect that the wage increase is extremely competitive in today's recessed economy. Instead, providing job stability, first class medical coverage, 401k match, and tuition reimbursement is greatly appreciated. Once we are established in our careers here it is much easier to stay with the management and coworkers we enjoy and understand. If Acme provides a sense of continuity for the engineering staff it will be easier for us to ignore recruiters and keep our focus on our projects at Acme. / Finally, make this a job my spouse loves. Make sure my benefits, my hours, and my stress level are congruent with my pay. Make sure I get the time off to go on my family vacation or enjoy my holidays. Because if my spouse likes Acme that means I don't feel pressure to leave this job when I'm at home. If you can keep my spouse happy, you keep me happy. (Note: telling me to stop bitching about my job when I get home is not an acceptable solution, per my meeting with the VP regarding this concern last year at this time.)
In order to retain and attain quality engineering talent Acme needs to review and formalize the following policies: / First, engineers are highly skilled professionals who deserve dignity in what is expected of them in the workplace. In order to foster this dignified environment Acme should consider flexible hours and the potential for telecommuting. The traditional 40 hour work week is a bit passe and not appropriate in today's technological environment. By allowing engineers the ability to get the job done according to a schedule that best works for them, we foster a greater work life balance and therefore have happier employees. This is not about 'butt in chair time,' it is about getting the job done and getting it done well. / The corporate culture at Acme should also be reviewed. Providing an open and honest environment that allows engineers to voice concerns without fear of repercussions is highly valued amongst employees. Also, management needs to be respectful of engineers as individuals; playing to our strengths and working to deflect potential conflicts so that we may do our jobs in a timely manner without having to deal with outside concerns. / Don't over-think the wage increase. We respect that the wage increase is extremely competitive in today's recessed economy. Instead, providing job stability, first class medical coverage, 401k match, and tuition reimbursement is greatly appreciated. Once we are established in our careers here it is much easier to stay with the management and coworkers we enjoy and understand. If Acme provides a sense of continuity for the engineering staff it will be easier for us to ignore recruiters and keep our focus on our projects at Acme. / Finally, make this a job my spouse loves. Make sure my benefits, my hours, and my stress level are congruent with my pay. Make sure I get the time off to go on my family vacation or enjoy my holidays. Because if my spouse likes Acme that means I don't feel pressure to leave this job when I'm at home. If you can keep my spouse happy, you keep me happy.

If financially plausible, this would provide the best return to the company over time by cutting the cost of both manufacturing and shipping product by reducing the amount of movement a product requires before it reaches the market. By reducing these shipping costs, over time the company will have a larger return and can increase the wages of Acme engineers. To combat this situation immediately, it may also be necessary to put some engineers in charge of the designing and building aspect of these manufacturing plants. This will keep engineers interested in their job by giving them some accountability for the success of the company, as well as a sense of pride for jobs because they know they are needed for such a specialized venture. While this doesn't' immediately solve the problem of reduced wage increases, being honest and straightforward with company employees about the situation will go a long way in keeping engineers content with their job. With the way the market is, people can understand that some companies need some time to turn themselves around and get back on their feet. If employees are notified of the smaller wage increases and projected future increases, they might be more willing to stick around in order to reap the rewards of an expanding, thriving company. As long as future wage projections are honest, there will be no reason for dissatisfaction or a decrease in productivity. Honesty is the key, and while some engineers may still be lost to other companies, it's very likely that many will hold their ground with a company that is very revealing and honest about its approach to business and how wages will be handled.
