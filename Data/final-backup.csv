3,"To begin I think that it is great that Becky has not continued to shoplift and is trying to get her life going in the right direction. In my life one of the quotes that I go by is ""watch the company that you keep"" I go by this because the people that you urround yourself with will be the people that you begin to look to for such things as advice and comfort. If those people are not heading in the same direction as you are with your life then it could become a burden on your life and start to hold you backfrom your goals. Becky's first problem is associating herself with someone who is continuously making the same mistake that she made by shoplifting. One solution that could work would be for Becky to sit down with Jim and rationally explain to him that wht he is doing is wrong and is not only hurting the store but in the long run could really hurt him, even if he thinks that he will never get caught. The manager of the Pizzeria has to know that Becky and Jim live together and since Becky already has a pas with shoplifting her manager will automatically connect her with the missing pizzas. If talking to Jim about it does not work then the next best thing to do in my opinion would be to either go to the manager and just let him know that you have been noticng that the stock for the pizzas has been decreasing and your not sure where the stock has been going to, so then the manager can look into it. Bringing it to his attention would clear up your name because you were honest. Or another thing you could do wold be to notify the manager that you do know for sure someone has been stealing pizzas but you do not know who it is, that way the manager can address the issue to the whole staff, leave the fact that you informed him out of it and then hopefully that woud give Jim a good enough reason to stop.",3.9719467,1.033758724,RLPS1,Becky,training,237,358,0.8294536471366880,0.8350894451141360,0.8291311860084530,0.5213193893432620,0.45856761932373000,0.24158373475074800,0.3777342140674590,0.24760758876800500,0.3934374153614040

227,"First of all, Becky should have talked to Jim much earlier regarding his inappropriate behavior. However, since she allowed the situation to elaborate, she should first give Jim a brief chance to make it up by having him pay for the pizzas. If he does, i is a win-win for Becky since she gets to keep her job, her roommate = half the rent, without having to worry about hurting her relationship with Mark.

However, if Jim refuses to pay, she can either try to a) blackmail him or b) go straight to Mark. Blckmailing may put Becky at risk since she already has a record of shoplifting, especially if there is no evidence that Jim took the pizzas himself. If Becky goes and tells Mark right away, she will be able to preserve her long standing relationship with hm and prove to him that her ""criminal"" past is really behind her. However, since Jim will probably lose his job, given his problematic work behavior at the pizzeria, he will most likely be unable to pay his half of the rent or simply move out altogether.

If Becky does not find a suitable roommate quickly, she will be forced to temporary go into debt. In Becky's case this would be the lesser of two evils, since if she simply stays quite about the case she is being entirely unfair to Mark; and is also at isk of multiple negative consequences such as, her losing the job and further hurting her chances of getting a new one.

559,"Clara is a busy student as well as a part time worker. I suggest that she works in between class breaks. In addition, best way to work around her classes is to work before her day starts with class or after school when she's finally done with classes. Therefore, when she gets home, she can use her time to work on her homework/ assignments. She must make sure her schedule doesnt conflict with her sleep, daily routine as well as family time. So she must make sure she follows a routine that's best suitable for her. For instance, Clara has class at 10 a.m, she will work the few hours from 7:30 am-9:30 am if she choose then use the 30 mins int between to get to class in time and relax for a bit. Lets say she's done for the day at 5 pm. She will work 5 p.m-8 p.m. Therefore, out of the 5 days a week of school, she is already getting approximately 25 hrs. In addition, she may also work weekends. Thus, she can rearrange the hours and adjusting the hours around to suit her best when it comes down to tough weeks such as preparations for exams etc and lastly, she will have enough time at night to finish her homework and half days of her weekends with family and friends.     Best option I would do if school offers her required classes in a two or three days a week, take that and she'll be happier than attending a 5 school days.

665,"Clara's current job is obviously problematic and her 15 hour credit load is only one class above the 12 credit minimum to qualify as a full-time student.  As such she could drop at most one class before she loses any financial aid that requires her to be full-time.  This brings about the only practical solution: changing her work schedule.  While Clara has openly stated she does not want to quit her job because it pays well and because she enjoys the work, her job is doing nothing to further her career and is in fact hampering it.    In many fields, a student working towards his or her degree can find paying internships at companies that employ people in the student's field of study.  Sometimes these jobs are no more glorified than Clara's current gopher job but at least a job that places her around medical professionals will give Clara a better view of what her future could look like.  Depending upon the company and job description of the internship, the hours Clara works could be very flexible meaning she could work just a few hours a week when final exams come up but a full 40 hours over Spring Break if she really wants the extra money.  Also, an internship could greatly increase Clara's chance of getting a full time job at the company after she complete school.    As for the financial aspect of this solution there is much speculation and few hard facts.  The definition of Clara's problem did not state if she was fully dependent upon her income or if she has any financial reserves to draw upon.  If she needs a job to pay her monthly bills and does not have a few months worth of expenses in savings, she obviously cannot just quit her job and hope for the best which makes transitioning between her current job and the proposed internship problematic.  A short term loan from Mom and Dad may solve this problem or she may need to apply for a loan from some form of a financial institution.  If Clara has been financially responsible she should have several months worth of rent and other expenses in her savings and she can use these funds to manage the switch between jobs.    In short, Clara needs an internship type job in a relevant industry where she can learn more about the career she is working towards.  Provided she has cash reserves and such jobs exist in the field she want to work in she should quit her job soon to increase her chances of successfully completing her classes.

Acme may not be able to compete with everything their competitors are doing to satisfy their employees, but even trying to compete in a couple ways could really make a difference. Worker benefits would be another way to keep employees happy. An example would be paid time off (PTO) that they could accumulate after so many days and hours worked that they didn't call in sick or that the employees were working efficiently. PTO could be cheaper than bonuses because there would have to be a incentive to get it and not everyone will work to get it. Other little things management could do is even something as simple as a food Friday, just providing a meal for employees or having a potluck. Little things show workers that their employees care make them feel important and noticed leaving them satisfied which makes them want to perform their job better to impress their bosses. One last idea, instead of a normal Christmas bonus which could cost the company hundreds of dollars, a little gift for each employer would be much cheaper! On that note, Acme company should look outside employment problems to figure out how to make more of a profit! Acme company might need to find a different shipping method or ship smarter to reduce that cost.

Most can agree that money is frequently at the root one's dissatisfaction in their career. Although Acme is unable to provide a larger wage increase, they could try offering stock options or perhaps extra benefits (like gas benefits etc) There are also many affordable options that Acme should consider to reduce this turn over rate. It's rather simple: create a pleasant work environment. This is not in reference to everybody getting along, but appealing to the human brain's desire for an aesthetically pleasing environment. These changes can be subtle and still produce happier workers. Acme could start by changing the lighting in the working area of the engineers by removing dim lighting and avoiding fluorescent lighting. More color in the environment could improve the attitude of their engineers towards their job; paint the walls (avoid grey or cream colors), brighten up common/break rooms, get more colorful art etc. Try to open up the space of their working area; minimize cubicles. Also, plants in the work environment have been proven to increase productivity and create what is perceived to be a ""healthier"" environment. All of these aspects have been proven to create a satisfying and productive environment in the home or at work. Despite the fact that other companies can provide ""more benefits"" or a ""better job"", they will most likely fail to match our productive and pleasant work environment.

In order to foster this dignified environment Acme should consider flexible hours and the potential for telecommuting. The traditional 40 hour work week is a bit passe and not appropriate in today's technological environment. By allowing engineers the ability to get the job done according to a schedule that best works for them, we foster a greater work life balance and therefore have happier employees. This is not about 'butt in chair time,' it is about getting the job done and getting it done well. / The corporate culture at Acme should also be reviewed. Providing an open and honest environment that allows engineers to voice concerns without fear of repercussions is highly valued amongst employees. Also, management needs to be respectful of engineers as individuals; playing to our strengths and working to deflect potential conflicts so that we may do our jobs in a timely manner without having to deal with outside concerns. / Don't over-think the wage increase. We respect that the wage increase is extremely competitive in today's recessed economy. Instead, providing job stability, first class medical coverage, 401k match, and tuition reimbursement is greatly appreciated. Once we are established in our careers here it is much easier to stay with the management and coworkers we enjoy and understand. If Acme provides a sense of continuity for the engineering staff it will be easier for us to ignore recruiters and keep our focus on our projects at Acme. / Finally, make this a job my spouse loves. Make sure my benefits, my hours, and my stress level are congruent with my pay. Make sure I get the time off to go on my family vacation or enjoy my holidays. Because if my spouse likes Acme that means I don't feel pressure to leave this job when I'm at home. If you can keep my spouse happy, you keep me happy.

1212,"My suggestion to improve both the companies financial standing, and the wages of Acme engineers is to open up new material manufacturing and shipping locations. If financially plausible, this would provide the best return to the company over time by cutting the cost of both manufacturing and shipping product by reducing the amount of movement a product requires before it reaches the market. By reducing these shipping costs, over time the company will have a larger return and can increase the wages of Acme engineers. To combat this situation immediately, it may also be necessary to put some engineers in charge of the designing and building aspect of these manufacturing plants. This will keep engineers interested in their job by giving them some accountability for the success of the company, as well as a sense of pride for jobs because they know they are needed for such a specialized venture. While this doesn't' immediately solve the problem of reduced wage increases, being honest and straightforward with company employees about the situation will go a long way in keeping engineers content with their job. With the way the market is, people can understand that some companies need some time to turn themselves around and get back on their feet. If employees are notified of the smaller wage increases and projected future increases, they might be more willing to stick around in order to reap the rewards of an expanding, thriving company. As long as future wage projections are honest, there will be no reason for dissatisfaction or a decrease in productivity.

Bottom achieving engineers shouldn't receive a 6 percent increase because their job performance doesn't reflect a raise. I would let them go if they found a better paying job because it's costing the company more money to keep them on  their current salary. I also believe that you need to reward the best employees that the company has. I think low turnover rate is important to the success of a company because a good company needs a veteran work force who has the confidence of the executive vice president. With there being an abundant of jobs available then there are a little of projects to be completed and you want your most qualified employees completing the projects.

1228,"Acme Company cannot prevent other companies from enticing their employees away. What it CAN do is provide employees with incentive to stay in their current positions, rather than leave for another company. There are several ways in which I think that this could be improved.  /  / First, on the issue of wage increases. In an environment where there is such high demand for engineers, Acme Company cannot continue to pay their engineers less than all of their competition. Neither can it most likely afford to raise wages higher than the competition. What I would propose would be a wage increase across the board from 6 percent to 8-9 percent per year, with incentive bonuses given for individual performance and for the overall group completing certain pre-defined objectives. Because this wage increase will still probably not be comparable to what is being offered at other companies, Acme Company should review it's policies to see if there are ways in which they can make their employees feel more cared-for. Ideas in this area could include: 1) Review of current insurance coverage, and attempts to obtain better coverage for employees; 2) Providing in-house day care services for employees; 3) Sponsoring various activities, such as a (mildly) competitive bowling league, game nights or instituting an occasional company outing at a restaurant or bar; 4) Creation of an anonymous suggestion box, where employees can inform management of grievances or can provide the company with new ideas to streamline processes within the company; 5) Provide small incentives, like movie passes or gift cards for attendance and performance on a smaller scale. 6) Improve and update equipment and workspace areas where possible (better chairs is always a good place to start - businesses usually have TERRIBLE chairs for employees); 7) Look into the possibility of allowing more flexibilities in work schedules, so as to allow employees to better balance work and home commitments. One area in which this could be implemented is to allow employees who perform adequately to work from home one day per week.  /  / The bottom line is that Acme needs to provide an environment that employees WANT to be in, otherwise, they will search for greener pastures.",1.512999286,1.8447627,RLPS4,Acme,training,1228,366,0.8263100385665890,0.831548273563385,0.8254529237747190,0.5306289792060850,0.4810311794281010,0.27786773443222000,0.3980163335800170,0.3018934726715090,0.4294905960559850

Outside of money, a worker is also satisfied if he has an opportunity to grow and eventually create something for themselves in the future. For a worker to stay at a company that pays less money, he has to be satisfied working there. The satisfaction could come from a modern workspace with one-of-a-kind equipment, providing bonuses to people that come up with ideas to improve the product, create a weekly schedule that is based on a four-day workweek. (studies in Finland have shown that a four-day workweek is more productive than a five-day workweek, even though the workers spend less time on a problem.)
