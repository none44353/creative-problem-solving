I think Becky should tell Jim that what he done is wrong and he should be the one who tell Mark about all the stealing pizza.,3.0590367,2.9940484,2.9012673,2.6837776,2.2609339,1.8188293,1.1873463,0.86593455,0.617112,0.5104053,0.48649538,-0.596276243
"To begin I think that it is great that Becky has not continued to shoplift and is trying to get her life going in the right direction. In my life one of the quotes that I go by is ""watch the company that you keep"" I go by this because the people that you urround yourself with will be the people that you begin to look to for such things as advice and comfort. If those people are not heading in the same direction as you are with your life then it could become a burden on your life and start to hold you backfrom your goals. Becky's first problem is associating herself with someone who is continuously making the same mistake that she made by shoplifting. One solution that could work would be for Becky to sit down with Jim and rationally explain to him that wht he is doing is wrong and is not only hurting the store but in the long run could really hurt him, even if he thinks that he will never get caught. The manager of the Pizzeria has to know that Becky and Jim live together and since Becky already has a pas with shoplifting her manager will automatically connect her with the missing pizzas. If talking to Jim about it does not work then the next best thing to do in my opinion would be to either go to the manager and just let him know that you have been noticng that the stock for the pizzas has been decreasing and your not sure where the stock has been going to, so then the manager can look into it. Bringing it to his attention would clear up your name because you were honest. Or another thing you could do wold be to notify the manager that you do know for sure someone has been stealing pizzas but you do not know who it is, that way the manager can address the issue to the whole staff, leave the fact that you informed him out of it and then hopefully that woud give Jim a good enough reason to stop.",3.3266513,3.3695455,3.4371665,3.4499085,3.3696237,3.3270035,3.0136824,2.6819181,2.0085318,1.6264764,1.4271019,1.033758724

"First of all, Becky should have talked to Jim much earlier regarding his inappropriate behavior. However, since she allowed the situation to elaborate, she should first give Jim a brief chance to make it up by having him pay for the pizzas. If he does, i is a win-win for Becky since she gets to keep her job, her roommate = half the rent, without having to worry about hurting her relationship with Mark.

However, if Jim refuses to pay, she can either try to a) blackmail him or b) go straight to Mark. Blckmailing may put Becky at risk since she already has a record of shoplifting, especially if there is no evidence that Jim took the pizzas himself. If Becky goes and tells Mark right away, she will be able to preserve her long standing relationship with hm and prove to him that her ""criminal"" past is really behind her. However, since Jim will probably lose his job, given his problematic work behavior at the pizzeria, he will most likely be unable to pay his half of the rent or simply move out altogether.

If Becky does not find a suitable roommate quickly, she will be forced to temporary go into debt. In Becky's case this would be the lesser of two evils, since if she simply stays quite about the case she is being entirely unfair to Mark; and is also at isk of multiple negative consequences such as, her losing the job and further hurting her chances of getting a new one.

There are two creative solutions in this situation. One would be for Becky to discuss her concrns with Jim before going to Mark and talk to him as a friend. She could explain that the things he is doing are detrimental to his job and that she doesn't wanthim to get fired because she likes working with him and because it provides an income so that they can remain roommates. Perhaps Jim will listen and change his ways. The second solution would be for Becky to go straight to Mark and explain Jims behaviors o him. She could ask to remain anonymous and could ask Mark to first talk to Jim about his actions before ultimately firing him.

"1.) Becky should tell Mark of Jim's behavior, but she also needs to explain her situation at home and with her jobs. This way, Mark understands that Becky needs Jim to keep his job to be able to pay for rent, but she has also done the ""right"" thing and sh has protected herself from withholding information from her boss. Doing so could lead to Becky not being able to acquire the shift manager position (and i'm assuming the higher position would result in increased pay), or Mark could even fire her as it wold appear they were working together to steal the food(assuming Mark found out about the theft). This way it would be up to Mark to make a decision, and out of Becky's hands. 
2.) Mark could tell Jim that a customer (or even a ""secret shopper"") had repored the stealing of the pizza, saving Becky's friendship with Jim, as he may not know it was her. He could then reduce Jim's work hours, as punishment, or could put Jim on the ""3-strikes-and-you're-out"" warning system. If this is the first time Jim has bee in trouble, then he has time to mend his attitude and to think about the consequences. If Jim is on a second account of mischief, then a written warning could suffice. Lastly, if Jim is on his third strike, and there is no other option other than to fireJim, Mark could suspend Jim for a number of days or weeks as punishment also.
