3,"To begin I think that it is great that Becky has not continued to shoplift and is trying to get her life going in the right direction. In my life one of the quotes that I go by is ""watch the company that you keep"" I go by this because the people that you urround yourself with will be the people that you begin to look to for such things as advice and comfort. If those people are not heading in the same direction as you are with your life then it could become a burden on your life and start to hold you backfrom your goals. Becky's first problem is associating herself with someone who is continuously making the same mistake that she made by shoplifting. One solution that could work would be for Becky to sit down with Jim and rationally explain to him that wht he is doing is wrong and is not only hurting the store but in the long run could really hurt him, even if he thinks that he will never get caught. The manager of the Pizzeria has to know that Becky and Jim live together and since Becky already has a pas with shoplifting her manager will automatically connect her with the missing pizzas. If talking to Jim about it does not work then the next best thing to do in my opinion would be to either go to the manager and just let him know that you have been noticng that the stock for the pizzas has been decreasing and your not sure where the stock has been going to, so then the manager can look into it. Bringing it to his attention would clear up your name because you were honest.

A solution to this issue may be for Becky to find Jim an alternate job where she does not feel as responsible to turn him in for bad behavior. This would eliminate the problem of telling someone about his behavior or if someone found out, Jim being out ofa job. Additionally, Becky could move on from her co-habitation and either move in with someone else who is more reliable at work so she does not have worry about Jim being able to make rent with the fear of him loosing his job. Then she could also tell Mrk about some of the problem behaviors of Jim and so if he got fired or punished, it would not reflect on Becky (as it would if the pizzas were brought up) but rather on his behaviors in general.",0.8187350630760193,0.825458288192749,0.620798647403717

If Becky goes and tells Mark right away, she will be able to preserve her long standing relationship with hm and prove to him that her ""criminal"" past is really behind her. However, since Jim will probably lose his job, given his problematic work behavior at the pizzeria, he will most likely be unable to pay his half of the rent or simply move out altogether.

747,"Prioritizing and time management needs to be more effectively addressed. Her current job as a ""gopher"" at an architectural design firm may seem to be of high importance at the moment, given that she needs money to pay for school, gas, food, and bills; but looking at her goals from a longterm perspective is a better way to help reprioritize her schedule. Because Clara is not receiving any practical experiences from her current job, I believe cutting down some of her work hours is an important sacrifice to be made for her future profession in the medical field. If the company does not allow Clara to cut her hours, she should consider looking for a more flexible job, in which she is given the option to work around her school hours and study time. She can also try to use better time management of studying more efficiently if she decides keeping her job at the designer firm is absolutely necessary to get by financially. This can be done by sacrificing other activities that Clara might enjoy engaging in, such as using the weekends to catch up on school materials.

What I would propose would be a wage increase across the board from 6 percent to 8-9 percent per year, with incentive bonuses given for individual performance and for the overall group completing certain pre-defined objectives. Because this wage increase will still probably not be comparable to what is being offered at other companies, Acme Company should review it's policies to see if there are ways in which they can make their employees feel more cared-for. Ideas in this area could include: 1) Review of current insurance coverage, and attempts to obtain better coverage for employees; 2) Providing in-house day care services for employees; 3) Sponsoring various activities, such as a (mildly) competitive bowling league, game nights or instituting an occasional company outing at a restaurant or bar; 4) Creation of an anonymous suggestion box, where employees can inform management of grievances or can provide the company with new ideas to streamline processes within the company; 5) Provide small incentives, like movie passes or gift cards for attendance and performance on a smaller scale. 6) Improve and update equipment and workspace areas where possible (better chairs is always a good place to start - businesses usually have TERRIBLE chairs for employees); 7) Look into the possibility of allowing more flexibilities in work schedules, so as to allow employees to better balance work and home commitments. One area in which this could be implemented is to allow employees who perform adequately to work from home one day per week.  /  / The bottom line is that Acme needs to provide an environment that employees WANT to be in, otherwise, they will search for greener pastures.",0.8248075246810913,0.8377766013145447,0.6358803510665894

They must also give these teenagers flexible schedules and lots of work benefits. That doesn't mean let employees run all over you but listen to their needs a lot more such as taking breaks when asked, or food products when asked. There should be no such thing as an employee discount for someone that works for you. They should be getting those things for free because at the end of the day they're making those daily profits.
My opinion is that if Acme feels as if they cannot increase the wages for their employees they should not be in business, but I will still suggest a solution. Acme can target a certain age group for hiring practices such as teenagers. Most teenagers do not need a job to live more so just to have their own money. They must also give these teenagers flexible schedules and lots of work benefits. That doesn't mean let employees run all over you but listen to their needs a lot more such as taking breaks when asked, or food products when asked.
