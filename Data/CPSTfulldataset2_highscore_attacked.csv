The recruiters can still say they have ""better"" jobs and ""better"" benefits, just the benefits wont be a raise, but instead a more enjoyable workplace.

Then, regardless of the Dr. Bundt chat, Joan can schedule a meeting with Dr. Johnson to express how she is losing enjoyment in the job. This will at least get her on the right path instead of struggling in silence.
