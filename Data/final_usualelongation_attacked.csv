286,"1.) Becky should tell Mark of Jim's behavior, but she also needs to explain her situation at home and with her jobs. This way, Mark understands that Becky needs Jim to keep his job to be able to pay for rent, but she has also done the ""right"" thing and sh has protected herself from withholding information from her boss. Doing so could lead to Becky not being able to acquire the shift manager position (and i'm assuming the higher position would result in increased pay), or Mark could even fire her as it wold appear they were working together to steal the food(assuming Mark found out about the theft). This way it would be up to Mark to make a decision, and out of Becky's hands. 
2.) Mark could tell Jim that a customer (or even a ""secret shopper"") had repored the stealing of the pizza, saving Becky's friendship with Jim, as he may not know it was her. He could then reduce Jim's work hours, as punishment, or could put Jim on the ""3-strikes-and-you're-out"" warning system. If this is the first time Jim has bee in trouble, then he has time to mend his attitude and to think about the consequences.

Becky should tell Mark of Jim's behavior, but she also needs to explain her situation at home and with her jobs. This way, Mark understands that Becky needs Jim to keep his job to be able to pay for rent, but she has also done the ""right"" thing and sh has protected herself from withholding information from her boss. Doing so could lead to Becky not being able to acquire the shift manager position (and i'm assuming the higher position would result in increased pay), or Mark could even fire her as it wold appear they were working together to steal the food(assuming Mark found out about the theft). This way it would be up to Mark to make a decision, and out of Becky's hands. 
2.) Mark could tell Jim that a customer (or even a ""secret shopper"") had repored the stealing of the pizza, saving Becky's friendship with Jim, as he may not know it was her.

I would assume that her job has set hours and so do the classes she is enrolled in, once those are entered into her calendar the week. She now can visualize the time she really has. It is amazing how much time we dont have, where in fact we have much more time than thought. We just usually spend it with friends, napping, watching TV, etc. Maybe talk to her friends and pick one night a week to spend with her friends and one night to spend with family. If watching TV try to do some basic homework, or get organized during this time (multitasking is a great quality). Finally, talk to those who you are close with and explain the situation to them. It is amazing how much can be done when you have support.

747,"Prioritizing and time management needs to be more effectively addressed. Her current job as a ""gopher"" at an architectural design firm may seem to be of high importance at the moment, given that she needs money to pay for school, gas, food, and bills; but looking at her goals from a longterm perspective is a better way to help reprioritize her schedule. Because Clara is not receiving any practical experiences from her current job, I believe cutting down some of her work hours is an important sacrifice to be made for her future profession in the medical field. If the company does not allow Clara to cut her hours, she should consider looking for a more flexible job, in which she is given the option to work around her school hours and study time. She can also try to use better time management of studying more efficiently if she decides keeping her job at the designer firm is absolutely necessary to get by financially.

Most can agree that money is frequently at the root one's dissatisfaction in their career.

With there being an abundant of jobs available then there are a little of projects to be completed and you want your most qualified employees completing the projects. I think trying to reduce product is bad because the more product that is made then the better the company will look to outsiders. They can also not fill positions after someone has left and that will help keep the costs down. Or try and hire people and lower pay and that will also help.

1228,"Acme Company cannot prevent other companies from enticing their employees away. What it CAN do is provide employees with incentive to stay in their current positions, rather than leave for another company. There are several ways in which I think that this could be improved.  /  / First, on the issue of wage increases. In an environment where there is such high demand for engineers, Acme Company cannot continue to pay their engineers less than all of their competition. Neither can it most likely afford to raise wages higher than the competition. What I would propose would be a wage increase across the board from 6 percent to 8-9 percent per year, with incentive bonuses given for individual performance and for the overall group completing certain pre-defined objectives.

1529,"Start looking for a job that pays well and is flexible with student hours (server, delivery driver, etc.). Schedule things around so that you can work as many hours as possible but still have ample time for studying. Setting aside specific study time is iportant. Start earning and saving money from the new job while also continuing your education. Then, sometime before winter snow hits, buy a vehicle from the uncle that will be dependable using the extra money you've saved from work. At this point, you ca cut back the hours if needed or just adjust to maintain your well-being. I think everyone wins with this plan.
