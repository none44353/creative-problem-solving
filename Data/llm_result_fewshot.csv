Secondly, if that does not work, I would ask for some time off to that she may catch up in her school work. If that is not an option either, than it would be better to consider looking for another job and possibly taking out some loans to help her in the mean time. Maybe she can take a position else where with fewer hours but similar pay.

In regards to making it more enticing, I think she should first try and get more involved with the other people in her research group who seem to be enjoying their time.

For productivity costs, looking for new partners in countries with less taxes is an idea to limit these expenses.
