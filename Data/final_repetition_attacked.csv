The definition of Clara's problem did not state if she was fully dependent upon her income or if she has any financial reserves to draw upon.  If she needs a job to pay her monthly bills and does not have a few months worth of expenses in savings, she obviously cannot just quit her job and hope for the best which makes transitioning between her current job and the proposed internship problematic.  A short term loan from Mom and Dad may solve this problem or she may need to apply for a loan from some form of a financial institution.  If Clara has been financially responsible she should have several months worth of rent and other expenses in her savings and she can use these funds to manage the switch between jobs.    In short, Clara needs an internship type job in a relevant industry where she can learn more about the career she is working towards.  Provided she has cash reserves and such jobs exist in the field she want to work in she should quit her job soon to increase her chances of successfully completing her classes.  Even if it takes a few months for her to secure an internship, the benefits of a educationally relevant job far outweigh the cost of the temporary depletion of her savings funds.",0.818962574005127,0.824366569519043,0.6341941356658936,0.03694438934326172,0.10638999938964844,0.17027223110198975,0.2650294899940491,0.3130820393562317,0.44091320037841797,3

This is not about 'butt in chair time,' it is about getting the job done and getting it done well. / The corporate culture at Acme should also be reviewed. Providing an open and honest environment that allows engineers to voice concerns without fear of repercussions is highly valued amongst employees. Also, management needs to be respectful of engineers as individuals; playing to our strengths and working to deflect potential conflicts so that we may do our jobs in a timely manner without having to deal with outside concerns. / Don't over-think the wage increase. We respect that the wage increase is extremely competitive in today's recessed economy. Instead, providing job stability, first class medical coverage, 401k match, and tuition reimbursement is greatly appreciated. Once we are established in our careers here it is much easier to stay with the management and coworkers we enjoy and understand. If Acme provides a sense of continuity for the engineering staff it will be easier for us to ignore recruiters and keep our focus on our projects at Acme. / Finally, make this a job my spouse loves.

Because if my spouse likes Acme that means I don't feel pressure to leave this job when I'm at home. If you can keep my spouse happy, you keep me happy.

There obviously needs to be something done about the wages.  A vast majority of workers contribute to a job only if they feel they are getting what they deserve from the work.  The workers are feeling underappreciated and for this reason there needs to be an increase in the wage increases.  Also, benefits could be improved in order to entice workers to stay.  These benefits, however, should only be given after the employee has worked there for a good amount of time. maybe a year to two years before certain benefits apply.  To increase production, there should be an attempt to increase accountability of for the products produced.  Perhaps splitting the engineers into smaller ""teams"" and pairing them with small ""teams"" of other departments likes sales and advertising would make everyone take more pride in their work.
