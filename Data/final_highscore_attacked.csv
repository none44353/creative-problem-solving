Many people are extremely motivated to pick a job based on how much money they will be making, but don't often initially consider traits about a company that would make them want to leave, such as a mean boss, or bad moral of coworkers. When advertising for positions at Acme, stress not only the salary, but that the employee would be fulfilling a need to society, that they are valued and wanted. Tell them that the facilities are state of the art, the managers are very supportive and constructive, and they will be an important contribution to a worthwhile cause. Creating an add for new employees or trying to console present employees, use the kind of supportive, inspirational mood as my manager did for me. Engineers may see that while they might not earn as much money as they could with a different company, Acme is a place where they will feel valued and not want to quit.
