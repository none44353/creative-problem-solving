You are tasked with rating the originality of solutions to this creative problem-solving task:

$problem

These solutions were generated by college students in a psychology experiment.

When assessing originality, consider three key aspects: novelty, imagination, and structure. Novelty refers to how unique the approach is compared to typical solutions. Imagination considers how creative and inventive the idea is. Structure examines whether the idea is limited by the scenario as presented, or if it questions assumptions and demonstrates out-of-the-box thinking.

Rate the solution as one in its totality, even if there are multiple parts or ideas. Do not “read into” the idea or assume intentions - rate based solely on what is written. Remember that originality is independent from quality - a solution can be highly original but low in quality, or vice versa.

Use a 5-point scale for rating, where:
0 is very unoriginal (very simple and/or common idea)
1 is unoriginal (simple idea, not novel or imaginative, structured by the scenario)
2 is neutral (limited novelty or imagination, still structured by the scenario)
3 is original (shows some novelty and imagination, less structured by the problem)
4 is very original (unique, novel, imaginative, and not structured by the scenario)

For the given solution, provide only a 0–4 originality rating. Do not explain your rating or provide any additional commentary.
